Lifesaving can be inherently dangerous. Serious accidents can and often do happen which may\nresult in property damage, physical injury and even death. All members are requested to have\nvoluntarily read and understood this warning and accept and acknowledge the inherent risks in\nlifesaving.\n5.

Further, the word their in this\nManual may be either plural or singular, where singular replaces the terms his or her.\nIt is imperative this Manual is read and fully understood by competition organisers, officials, team\nmanagers, coaches, and competitors.\nCraig van Rooyen\nDirector of Sport\nLifesaving South Africa\n\nPreface: Page iii (17th Edition)\n\nLIFESAVING AND SPORT\nThe Lifesaving","r replaces the terms his or her.\nIt is imperative this Manual is read and fully understood by competition organisers, officials, team\nmanagers, coaches, and competitors.\nCraig van Rooyen\nDirector of Sport\nLifesaving South Africa\n\nPreface: Page iii (17th Edition)\n\nLIFESAVING AND SPORT\nThe Lifesaving South Africa (LSA) is the national authority for drowning prevention, lifesaving and\nlifesaving sport. LSA is a non-profit, non-political, non-religious, national lifesaving sport and\nhumanitarian organisation. LSA leads, collaborates and partners with national and international\norganisations to prevent drowning, to promote the provision of lifesaving services and oversee lifesaving\nsport throughout South Africa and in the region.\nLSA promotes and organises lifesaving sport and regularly organises national aquatic lifesaving\ncompetitions in order to stimulate the interest of competitors to improve their ability and willingness to\nsave people who are in danger in the aquatic environment. Lifesaving sport helps develop the lifesavers'\nskills, knowledge and techniques, and plays an important role in providing opportunities to enhance\nrelationships among members.\nLSA is a member of the South African National Olympic Committee and through the International\nLifesaving Federation (ILS) is a member of or has relations with the following International Sport\nOrganisations:\n1. International Olympic Committee (IOC): ILS is an IOC recognised International Federation.\n2. Sportaccord (International Federation regrouping all International Sports Federations): ILS is a\nfull and voting member of Sportaccord.\n3. Association of Recognised International Sport Federations (ARISF): ILS is a full and voting\nmember of ARISF.\n4. International World Games Association (IWGA): ILS is a full and voting Member of IWGA.\n5. International Masters Games Federation (IMGF): ILS is a co-opted member of the IMGF.\n6. Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF): Lifesaving sport is a recognised sport by the CGF.\n7. International Military Sports Council (CISM): Lifesaving is a recognised sport by CISM.\n8. ILS also has official relations with the World Health Organisation (WHO) for drowning prevention\nactivities.\nLifesaving sport engages youth and adults from all nations in the mutual pursuit of excellence in\nlifesaving. The global focus on cooperation and teamwork to reduce the burden of drowning is a\ncompelling opportunity. Increasing the participation of youth in lifesaving sport is part of the engagement\nstrategy.\nLifesaving sport is an important component of this mission. The LSA National Lifesaving Championships\nand LSA Regional Championships play an important part in bringing together South African lifesavers on\na regular basis helping our members learn from the experience of other regions and to challenge\nthemselves to improve and perform. The public profile and media exposure to lifesaving sport helps\nprofile our vision, mission, values and strategic goals as the national authority in the effort to prevent\ndrowning.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe International Lifesaving Federation (ILS) Competition Manual (2019 Edition) and Surf Life Saving\nAustralia Limited (SLSA), Australian Surf Sports Manual, Manual No.3, 37th Edition of November 2021,\nhave given guidance in compiling this Competition Manual.\nIn particular, LSA acknowledges the following persons for their significant contributions to the 17th edition\n(November, 2022) of this manual:\nHandbook Revision Sub-Committee: Jelle Meintsma - Convenor\nJohn Coyne\nGraham Lewis\nAnnelie Lourens\nAllen Pembroke\nMarna Pieterse\n\nPreface: Page iv (17th Edition)\n\nPREFACE TO THE SEVENTEENTH EDITION\nLSA reviews the Competition Manual on a regular basis to keep pace with changes implemented by ILS\nand other lifesaving federations.

The host is responsible for the provision of\nadequate resources to ensure the safety and security of those involved with a competition. The Host shall\nappoint a Safety Officer who is responsible for ensuring that all competition facilities and environments\nare safe for use, and that the appropriate safety plan, and infectious disease plan (where required),\nequipment, rescue watercraft, procedures and emergency personnel are in place to ensure the safety of\ncompetitors, officials and spectators, etc. The Safety Officer is a member of the Competition Committee\nand is Chair of the Championships Safety Committee.\nThe provision of a safe environment at all LSA competitions is paramount.\n1.1\nPRELIMINARY\nPrior to the commencement of any competition the Competition Committee must be satisfied that all\ncompetition and non-competition arrangements provide the necessary safety for competitors, officials and\nother personnel involved at the competition. The Competition Committee must also be satisfied that the\nconditions are satisfactory for competition to proceed. Tests may be undertaken to assist in these\nassessment processes. A Surf and Open Water Event Safety Guide Sheet and Chief Referee PreCompetition Checklist may be used to assist in the assessment processes (refer Appendices A and B in\nthis section for samples).\nShould, at any stage prior to or during competition, there is a credible basis for concluding there is an\nunreasonable risk of serious injury occurring, the Chief Referee in consultation with the Safety Officer\nshall suspend all or parts of the competition. The Competition Committee will meet and, shall then decide\nwhether to postpone, cancel or relocate all or parts of the competition.\nThe Safety Officer shall be appointed by the relevant authority who must consider and advise the\nOrganizing and Competition Committee on all matters relating to competition and non-competition safety,\nsecurity and emergency services. For larger competitions it may be appropriate to appoint an emergency\nand safety committee representing the various role responsibilities. The Chair of such a committee shall\nbe appointed to the Organizing and Competition Committees. Formal records of advice provided must be\ntaken and kept.\nIn addition, where required, LSA has the authority to seek assessment of the physical and psychological\nfitness of any competitor or official and ensure through the Chief Referee to the Competition Committee\nthat an unfit competitor or official does not compete or officiate for the well-being and safety of others\ninvolved in a competition.\nNo surf or open w","assessment of the physical and psychological\nfitness of any competitor or official and ensure through the Chief Referee to the Competition Committee\nthat an unfit competitor or official does not compete or officiate for the well-being and safety of others\ninvolved in a competition.\nNo surf or open water event shall be conducted until the Chief Referee or Safety Officer has assessed the\nsurf or open water conditions and reported to the Competition Committee. Only the Competition\nCommittee has the authority to cancel, reschedule, or relocate the competition or event. The Chief\nReferee or the Safety Officer shall assume control of emergencies arising during competition.\nFurthermore, no competition shall be conducted until the Competition Committee is satisfied that the\ncompetition facilities are safe and secure, and that the appropriate safety and emergency plan, security\nplan, equipment, procedures, and personnel are in place.\nAt all competitions, the organising group conducting the competition shall provide sufficient and properly\nequipped and qualified water safety personnel (at each venue) as required by the appropriate lifesaving\nauthority. The provision of rescue watercraft and communication network is essential at all competitions.\nNo event shall commence unless a viable means of rescuing an unconscious person from water is in\nplace, i.e. a crewed rescue watercraft is on the water in the competition area. If an emergency arises\nduring a competition, correct control and procedures shall be maintained under the direction of the Chief\nReferee or Safety Officer.\nNote: Subject to conditions, and unless otherwise authorised by the Competition Committee, no surf or\nopen water events shall conclude less than a minimum of ninety minutes (1 hours) before sun-\n\n\nSection 1 Competition Safety\n\nset or if there is insufficient light to enable an effective search and rescue operation (SAR) to be\nundertaken in the event of a missing participant.\nThe Chief Referee or the appointed Safety Officer (as named in the safety and emergency plan) shall\nassume control of emergencies arising during competition.\nIf an emergency arises during a competition, correct command and control shall be maintained under the\ndirection of the Safety Officer or the Chief Referee (if a dedicated Safety Officer is not appointed).\nDuring an emergency, any member of LSA entering the water or handling any rescue equipment must\nonly do so at the direction of the Safety Officer or delegate and/or under the direction of the Police or\nemergency authority.\nA log (including written notes, photographs and/or audio or visual recordings where applicable) of\nresponses to all rescues, emergencies or major incidents is to be maintained for reference.\n1.2\nSAFETY AT SPORT AND RECREATION EVENTS ACT (ACT No. 2 OF 2010)\nOrganisers of lifesaving competitions and sporting events should take note of the Safety at Sport and\nRecreation Events Act and comply with all the requirements set out in the act. That includes:\n1. The preparation of a Safety and Emergency Plan\n2. Appointment of a Safety Officer\n3. Liaison with South African Police Services\n4. Liaison with other Safety and Security organisations, such as the local authority, emergency\nservice, etc.\n5. Comply with other acts, such as the Occupational Health and Safety Act, etc.\n1.3 SAFETY PERSONNEL AND SAFETY AT NIPPER COMPETITIONS\nIn Nipper competitions, preferably no water events may be held unless there are Safety Lifeguards with\nRescue Torpedo Buoys (RTB) or Rescue Tubes (R/T) in attendance. However, depending on surf and\nenvironmental conditions prevailing at the time, at the discretion of the Chief Referee and Safety Officer\nthe number of Safety Lifeguards may be reduced, provided that the safety of competitors is not\ncompromised. Also if there are fewer than 10 competitors in an event, a decision may be taken to reduce\nthe number of Safety Lifeguards proportional to the number of competitors, but as not to compromise the\nsafety aspect of such event.\nTo meet the requirements of LSA, the following shall apply:\n\nOne Safety Lifeguard to five competitors; or\n\nOne Safety Lifeguard to 10 competitors where low risk conditions are determined by completion\nof an Event Safety Guide Sheet.\nThis decision will be made by the Safety Officer and Chief Referee.\nNote1:\n\nA minimal risk condition is generally described as surf conditions under one meter, however,\nother surf and environmental conditions should also be factored into an assessment.\nNote 2: The requirement for a crewed rescue watercraft detailed above counts as two water safety\npersonnel.\nNote 3: A Safety Lifeguard must have an LA (Surf or Open Water) or JLA (Surf or Open Water) award,\nwith a valid Annual Retest, and must wear a red/yellow duty skull cap for identification. The\nSafety Lifeguard who is a holder of a JLA (Surf or Open Water) should be the holder of a JLA\naward for at least 1 year.\nNote 4: Safety Lifeguards must carry at least a Rescue Torpedo Buoy (RTB) or Rescue Tube (R/T).\nCompetitors who are assisted by Safety Lifeguards will no longer be allowed to take part in the event and\nwill not be considered in the final placing of the event.\nManagers and Coaches should not force nippers to enter events against their will, if the nipper does not\nhave the confidence or if the nipper is not physically capable to enter the event. Managers should also\nensure that the nippers are competent and capable to complete the events they have been entered. The\nChief Referee and Safety Officer will have the right to withdraw a nipper at the start of an event in cases\n\n\nSection 1 Competition Safety\n\nwhere the surf or open water conditions are not considered suitable or during an event if in their opinion it\nis unsafe or if it is perceived that the nipper is not capable of completing the event.\n1.4\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES\nThe host shall appoint the Safety Officer who is responsible for ensuring that all competition facilities and\nenvironments are safe for use,","able or during an event if in their opinion it\nis unsafe or if it is perceived that the nipper is not capable of completing the event.\n1.4\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES\nThe host shall appoint the Safety Officer who is responsible for ensuring that all competition facilities and\nenvironments are safe for use, and that the appropriate safety plan, and infectious disease plan (where\nrequired), equipment, rescue watercraft, procedures and emergency personnel are in place to ensure the\nsafety of competitors, officials and spectators, etc. The Safety Officer is a member of the Competition\nCommittee and is Chair of the Championships Safety Committee.\n1.5\nSAFETY AND EMERGENCY PLAN\nA Safety and Emergency Plan relevant to the scope of the competition being conducted is essential to the\nsound planning process. The plan should ensure appropriate procedures are in place if an incident or\nemergency occurs during a competition. The contents of a manual are not limited to, but may include the\nfollowing sections:\n1.5.1 Objectives\nThe objectives of the plan are to:\n\nOutline the facilities that will be utilised during the event.\n\nIdentify those persons with the authority to initiate the plan.\n\nOutline command and control functions.\n\nState the activation methods for internal and external agencies and services.\nThe host organising committee shall prepare a safety and emergency plan to ensure:\n The venue(s) are fit and proper for the purposes of competition.\n The general safety of competitors, technical officials, competition personnel and spectators.\n\nThe personnel and procedures are in place in case of minor or major emergencies involving\ninjury to or illness of competitors, technical officials, competition personnel or spectators.\nThe plan shall:\n Outline the facilities to be used during the competition by competitors, technical officials,\ncompetition personnel, and spectators.\n Identify the individuals with authority to initiate the plan and the chain of command and\ncoordination of emergency services.\n Identify safety personnel and protocols including land and water patrols and their respective job\ndescriptions.\n Identify logistical information necessary for the deployment of emergency services: personnel\nand their deployment, access to competition venues, equipment, communications protocol and\nmethods, vehicle access, and alternate venue(s).\n Identify the emergency care facilities including the number, location and type of first aid sites, the\nequipment at each site, and the personnel in place or on call to staff these sites. The plan will\nidentify on-site and off-site medical facilities including the location and contact details of the\nnearest medical centre and hospital.\n Identify the protocols for the operation of the emergency vehicle(s) on hand in case of the need to\ntransport patients from or rescue teams to an incident site.\n Identify the start and finish times of competition in surf and open water to allow for sufficient light\nfor search and rescue (SAR) operations in the event of a missing competitor.\n Identify available emergency services and their tasking protocols and specify how internal and\nexternal agencies and services are to be activated.\n Specify the decision-making responsibility in the event of death or serious injury to a competitor,\ntechnical official, competition personnel or spectator during the competition.\nThe plan shall be shared with the local agencies and services expected to participate in case of\nemergency and shall be explained at team managers and officials briefings. An outline of the plan\nincluding availability and details of emergency medical facilities should also be provided to each team\nmanager and be available and promoted to all competition personnel.\n1.5.2 Initiation of the Plan\nProper command and control must be maintained in an emergency or major incident. It is essential that\nthe instructions outlined in the plan are widely communicated and that personnel who have the authority\n\nSection 1 Competition Safety\n\nto activate the plan are identified. In this regard, those key persons usually are the Safety Officer, Chief\nReferee and the Competition Organiser or the Event Manager.\n1.5.3 First Aid and Medical\nDependent on the size of the competition and the number of competitors, the extent of the emergency\ncare facilities required including the number, location, and type of first aid sites will need to be identified.\nThe scope may include a central base, a medical centre, remote sites, and roving patrols as well as the\nequipment required and the number of personnel and their skills. Medical facilities, on and off the\ncompetition site, need to be identified. This should include the location and contact details of the nearest\nmedical centre and hospital.\n1.5.4 Water Safety\nThe Area Risk and Response Officer(s), Water Safety Coordinator(s), water safety personnel and\nemergency safety personnel (Rescue Watercraft or other suitable craft) are to be appointed and operate\nas per their position description. In addition, liaison and rescue protocols need to be identified and\npromulgated.\n1.5.5 Emergency Vehicle(s)\nAt competitions where there are many competitors, or the site is spread over a long distance, an\nemergency vehicle and/or ATV should be available in case of the need to transport patients off the beach\nand/or rescue teams to an incident site. The protocols for operation of the vehicle need to be detailed in\nthe plan.\n1.5.6 Major Incidents\nDependent on the size of the competition, and the risks involved, the preparation of emergency plans\nshould be completed. A sample disaster plan for a major incident is contained in Appendix C of this\nSection.\n1.5.7 Emergency Services\nEmergency Services tasking protocols should be included in the plan for:\n\nAmbulance\n\nPolice\n\nRescue Helicopter\n\nPeer Support\n1.5.8 Logistics\nAs necessary, relevant logistical information for deployment of the safety teams should be identified\nincluding:\n\nPersonnel\n\nDeployment of personnel\n\nDress standards and a","rvices tasking protocols should be included in the plan for:\n\nAmbulance\n\nPolice\n\nRescue Helicopter\n\nPeer Support\n1.5.8 Logistics\nAs necessary, relevant logistical information for deployment of the safety teams should be identified\nincluding:\n\nPersonnel\n\nDeployment of personnel\n\nDress standards and appearance\n\nAccess to arenas\n\nEquipment\n\nCommunications\n\nVehicle access\n\nAlternative venue(s)\n1.6\nCOMPETITION SAFETY ASSESSMENT\nBefore any LSA competition is conducted, the Safety Officer or the appointed delegate should assess the\nprevailing and expected conditions. Assessments may be undertaken at any time before and during\ncompetition. The Safety Officer should also assess the non-competition aspects including infectious\ndisease control, occupational health and safety matters.\nShould an assessment indicate that part, or all the competition, not be conducted because of adverse\nweather conditions, or another threat, a decision will be required from the Competition Committee on\nwhether to postpone, cancel or relocate all or parts of the competition. The Competition Committee shall\nconsist of a minimum of the following persons: The Chief Referee and the Deputy, Chairman of the Local\nOrganising Committee, Event Manager, the Safety Officer and where applicable, the Director of Sport or\nthe appointed delegate.\n\nSection 1 Competition Safety\n\nThe major threat for the conduct of competition relates to the advent of adverse weather conditions, either\nbefore or during the competition. Adverse weather can create extremes in heat or cold, storms,\ndangerous surf and aquatic conditions or swell and associated dangers for competitors. Secondary\nnatural threats are considered less likely, although man-made disasters, such as pollution of the surf,\nopen water, pool or beach should not be discounted. The sample Event Safety Guide Worksheet\n(Appendix A in this section) or a competition safety assessment designed for a particular event may assist\nin the assessment process.\n1.7\nUSE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)\nLSA may mandate the use of LSA approved Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including high visibility\nvests, lifejackets and/or helmets in its competitions.\nUsage of PPE shall either be optional in some events or compulsory, dependent on the event or age\ncategories e.g. high visibility vests in water events.\nWhen mandated competitors must wear the prescribed PPE in events and warm up/down areas etc. or\nthey shall not be permitted to participate at the competition.\nDetailed usage of PPE is contained in Section 2: General Competitive Conditions and/or other relevant\ndiscipline sections of this manual.\n1.8\nCOMPETITION CONTINGENCY PLAN\nIf the Competition Committee decides to postpone, cancel, or relocate all or parts of the competition event\na clear and simple Contingency Plan should be implemented and endorsed by the Competition\nCommittee.\nThe following is a suggested format for establishing a Contingency Plan for surf lifesaving competitions.\nNote: The contingency options for rescheduling of events at major LSA Championships is reproduced in\nAppendix E.\n1.8.1\n\nPotential Risks/Hazards\nAdverse weather and/or surf and open water conditions\nDisasters\nNon-competition matters\n\n1.8.2 Weather Forecasting\nWeather forecasts, including advice on available light, will be used by the Competition Committee to\nassist in decision making. If adverse weather and/or surf conditions develop, more regular bulletins and\ninformation must be sought and obtained. Subject to the size of the competition, and its specific risk\nassessment, weather monitoring should commence approximately one week prior to the start of the\ncompetition.\nIf the competition extends beyond one day, the Competition Committee should review weather and surf\nforecasts each morning and evening.\n1.8.3 The Chain of Command and Decision Making\nThe Safety and Emergency Committee shall determine the response to hazards as they occur, or\notherwise as required and provide safety advice to the Competition Committee. The sole responsibility for\ncancellation, postponement, or relocation of part or all of the competition rests with the Competition\nCommittee. (See appendix D)\nThe decision to enact the Contingency Plan is the responsibility of the Competition Committee. The\nSafety Officer is solely responsible to the Competition Committee for recommendations concerning\ncompetition safety.\n1.8.4\n\nAlternative Locations Contingencies\nAlternative surf or open water location(s)\n\nSection 1 Competition Safety\n\nEmergency locations protected water\n\n1.8.5 Aim and Principles of Relocation\nRelocation means relocation of all personnel (competitors and officials) and equipment (including water\nsafety and first aid) necessary to conduct the relevant competition(s). It does not necessarily mean back\nof competition area items such as stands or signage.\nThe aim of relocating to an alternative venue is to ensure that the competition is safely conducted within\nthe timeframe set down by the Competition Committee.\nIf water conditions prevent water-based competition, and the beach itself is unaffected, then only water\nevents may need to be relocated.\n1.8.6 Outline Plan\nThere are four primary options:\n\nComplete relocation of the competition.\n\nPartial relocation, where only those events considered unsafe will be relocated.\n\nPostponement of part, or all, of the competition to a later date.\n\nCancellation of part, or all, of the competition.\nShould a decision be made to continue with competition it might be required to reschedule and or\nrationalise the competition programme. This may include prioritisation of events and/or age groups and\nthe cancellation of some events and/or age groups.\nProvided that competition can proceed safely Appendix E details a suggested event priority matrix with\npreference being given to open events then decreasing ages to younger age groups and simultaneously\nincreasing Masters ages.\n1.8.7 Reconnaissance of Alternative Locations and Assessment of Conditions\nThe conduc","competition can proceed safely Appendix E details a suggested event priority matrix with\npreference being given to open events then decreasing ages to younger age groups and simultaneously\nincreasing Masters ages.\n1.8.7 Reconnaissance of Alternative Locations and Assessment of Conditions\nThe conduct of the reconnaissance is the responsibility of the Competition Committee. The\nreconnaissance group may consist of the Competition Organiser, Event Manager and Deputy, the Chief\nReferee, Deputy Referee, Safety Officer and the appropriate Area Referee(s), where possible, who will\njointly assess the situation and report to the Competition Committee for decision.\n1.8.8 Relocation Timings and Early Warning\nThe decision to relocate should be made as early as possible, preferably on the day before.\nThe following individuals and authorities are to be advised as soon as possible of the decision to relocate\nthe events to be moved and outline timings on the commencement of operations at the alternative site\n(those responsible for notification listed in brackets):\n Team Managers, all Referees and Officials (Chief Referee)\n Water Safety, First Aid, Communications and, if applicable, the relevant Emergency Service\nagencies (Police, Ambulance, Hospitals etc.) (Safety Officer)\n Administration Officer, TV, Sponsors, Announcers, Media, Club at Alternative Location, Catering,\nCouncil, Lifeguard Services, and other relevant Authorities, Announcers with scripted message \n(Logistics Officer/Event Manager)\n Optimal use is to be made of the public address system, social media, digital short messaging\nservices, etc., as well as face to face briefings as soon as the decision is made.\n1.8.9 Key Officials required at the Alternative Location\nOnce the Competition Committee has made the decision to move either the whole, or part of the\ncompetition, it is the responsibility of the Competition Organiser and Chief Referee to determine the\nmovement of officials. Planning is essential because the competition may need to be conducted in two\nlocations simultaneously. The exact number of officials, safety and support staff required at the alternative\nlocations will be determined at the time and will be dependent upon the number of events to be relocated.\nThe appointed Chief Referee (at the alternative location) is responsible for the setup of the competition at\nthe alternative location.\n\n\nSection 1 Competition Safety\n\n1.8.10 Movement of Competition Officials\nIf the entire competition is to be moved, the officials are to be moved as quickly as possible.\nTransport operators or other sources may need to be on standby to transport officials, depending on the\nsize of the competition.\n1.8.11 Movement of Safety and Rescue Personnel and Equipment\nThe relocation of Water Safety, First Aid and Rescue Equipment is the responsibility of the Safety Officer.\nThe Safety Officer will arrange transportation of personnel and their equipment\n.\n1.8.12 Movement of Administration and Competition/Championship Equipment\nMovement of the administration and competition equipment and ancillary equipment is the responsibility\nof the Logistics Officer/Site Manager and the Equipment Coordinator.\n1.8.13 Movement of Competitors and their Equipment\nMovement of all competitors and their equipment is the responsibility of the competitors. Details of\ntransport arrangements from the competition site to the alternative location may be advised over the\npublic address system and/or via information on a notice board.\n1.8.14 Action in the event of Death or Serious Injury\nIn the event of death or serious injury to a competitor or spectator during the period of the competition, the\nChief Referee is responsible for any immediate decision to suspend or postpone competition. The Safety\nOfficer is responsible to the Competition Committee for handling the situation.\n1.8.15 Provision of Counselling Services\nDependant on the size of the event, the Peer Support Coordinator is responsible for the contact and\nprovision of initial counselling support. If this position is not applicable, it is the responsibility of the Safety\nOfficer. This may be initiated via local centre as per lifesaving standard operating procedures.\n1.9\nTHUNDERSTORMS AND LIGHTNING\nIf there is lightning activity within approximately 10 km of the competition area (to estimate the distance\nfrom a thunderstorm, count from the number of seconds between a flash of lightning and the next clap of\nthunder, and divide this number by 3 to get the number of kilometres) and thunder less than 30 seconds\nafter a lightning flash indicates people are at risk, and if this occurs, all lifesaving activities in the water\n(open air pool, or at surf (beach and water events)) or open water should be stopped immediately and all\ncompetitors and officials should exit the water and everyone (competitors, officials, including spectators)\nshould immediately vacate the venue and locate to a solid building, like a clubhouse. If there is no building\nnearby, people should seek shelter inside a motor vehicle (Note: Not in the back of a Bakkie/ Light\nDelivery Vehicle).\nIf available, the Safety Officer or the Chief Referee should make use of a Lightning detector to monitor\npossible lighting threat.\nAll activities can be resumed approximately 30 minutes after the storm has moved on.\nNote: Each time lightning is observed or thunder heard the 30-minute clock should be reset.\n1.10 LSA MEMBERS HEALTH\nCompetitors and all Technical Officials should realise the importance of fitness to undertake their\nrespective activities and should seek expert advice on all aspects of their health. Competitors and\nTechnical Officials who suffer illness should consult their own doctor for advice on whether to continue\nparticipation and training if they are in any doubt. This applies specially to fevers and diarrhoea and\ninjuries can also be aggravated. Often a coach will recognise early symptoms of any over training\nsymptoms and prescribe an alternate program.\nLSA has adop","doctor for advice on whether to continue\nparticipation and training if they are in any doubt. This applies specially to fevers and diarrhoea and\ninjuries can also be aggravated. Often a coach will recognise early symptoms of any over training\nsymptoms and prescribe an alternate program.\nLSA has adopted the Drug Free Sport South Africa Institute policy which is in general, very similar to the\npolicy of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and International Lifesaving Federation (ILS). The\n\n\nSection 1 Competition Safety\n\nmedical advice to all members is to avoid all so-called performance enhancing drugs and to be careful of\ntaking any medication at all in the weeks leading up to an event.\nBefore and during training and during competition, an individuals level of hydration, availability of glucose,\nand body temperature, are important considerations. It is possible that medical teams may be required to\ndeal with cases of hyperthermia (overheating) and hypothermia (subnormal body temperature). The\ngeneral rule is to be aware of these potential problems and take suitable precautions. Technical Officials\nare often at the same risk as competitors. Competitors and Technical Officials alike need to ensure they\nlead a lifestyle conducive to their best performance. Competitors and Technical Officials should realise\nthe importance of fitness but should seek expert advice on correct training programs. Illness or injury from\nexercise occurs more often from training than actual competition and the competitor should seek advice\non how to minimise injuries.\nEndurance events require special consideration in many areas and have been well covered in various\nreports and circulars, etc. Competitors education is vital for the safe conduct of these events, especially\nwhen some or all competitors are juniors or novices.\nGenerally, Technical Officials are more at risk in terms of exposure to UV rays from the sun than\ncompetitors. It is strongly recommended that Technical Officials take care when officiating in the open. It\nis recommended that a suitable sunscreen lotion (at least a SPF 20+) is applied regularly, especially if the\nTechnical Official is in a boat. In addition, it is recommended Technical Officials wear a wide brimmed hat\nand long-sleeved shirt and take in enough fluid to avoid dehydration.\nMedical advice for competitors and Technical Officials is updated regularly by way of circulars that are\nsent to all clubs and are available from LSA.\n1.11 NO RELIANCE\nThe contents of this Section 1 are intended as a generalised summary only and should not be used or\nrelied upon as a substitute for professional risk management safety advice.\nMembers are also reminded to refer to the Introduction to this manual. It is imperative this manual is read\nand fully understood by competition organisers, Technical Officials, Team Managers, coaches and\ncompetitors.\n\n\nSection 1 Competition Safety\n\nAPPENDIX A: SAMPLE SURF AND OPEN WATER EVENT SAFETY GUIDE WORKSHEET\nSAMPLE SURF AND OPEN WATER EVENT SAFETY GUIDE WORKSHEET\nIn applying the worksheet event organisers must focus on safety in a way that does not cause them to\nhave or question conflicting views as to whether competition should continue. Event Officials must\nsuspend competition whenever there is a credible basis for concluding there is an unreasonable risk of\nserious injury to competitors occurring.\nEVENT: ......................................................................................................................................................\nDATE: ............................................................................................................................\n1.

Adjustment of the buoys may be necessary during the\ncompetition if they move out of alignment.\nCourse Distances: All courses shall be measured, set, and aligned to the Chief\nReferees satisfaction ensuring as far as possible that all lanes have fair and equal\nconditions.\nCourse Set-Up: The Competition Committee and Chief Referee may authorize\nadjustments to course set-ups to ensure the safety, fair judging and efficient running\nof the event (e.g., distances, number of lanes or buoys, number of competitors per\nrace). If heats have commenced, the course should not be changed until all heats in\nthe event have been concluded so as not to change course for later heats. Any course\nchanges must be communicated to competitors prior to the start of the race (e.g., at\nthe team managers briefing, in the marshalling area, or at the start).\nProtests against Course: Protests against the course will only be accepted prior to\nthe start of each event or race.\nMarshalling of Events: Competitors will not be permitted to commence in an event\nif they have not previously registered with the marshal and/or are late reporting to the\nmarshalling area. To assist the organizers in determining how many heats may be\nrequired, events may be marshalled the day before or at the start of the day the event\nis scheduled.\nStarts and False Starts: Start decisions by the starter or Chief Referee (or Chief\nReferees designate) are not subject to protest or appeal. A race start not called by\neither the starter or check starter as a false start is regarded as a legitimate start\nand no protest and/or appeal will be entertained.\nFinish Decisions: Judges

Buoy distances shall normally be\nmeasured from the end of knee depth water at the low tide mark (taking into account varying\nconditions such as sandbars, exclusion of holes and rips, surf conditions, prevailing winds and\nsafety factors).\nThe setting of beach positions, start lines, turning and finish flags and judging stands shall\nconsider sand, surf and water conditions and prevailing winds to ensure that, as far as possible,\na fair and equal course for all competitors is established.\nCourses may be adjusted at any time during competition to address safety, account for\nsignificant tidal, sea and beach condition changes and maintain compliance and course\nfairness.\nPrior to commencement of each race the Chief Referee or Sectional Referee shall check\ncourses to ensure compliance with the rules of the event and this section.\nNote:\n\nProtests may only be accepted on a competition course prior to the start of an event or\na race.\n\n4.2.6\nHazardous Conditions: The Organizing Committee, in consultation with the Chief\nReferee, has the authority to cancel or reschedule an event or final. If cancellation should\noccur, even after the conducting of some heats, etc., then no points from that event will be\ncredited to any competitor or team in the overall point score. The decision to cancel an event\nby the Chief Referee is not subject to challenge by a competitor, Team Manager or other\nlifesaving authority.\nIf the cancellation of the competition occurs due to hazardous surf conditions, lightning/thunder\nstorms or insufficient beach is available due to tidal change, extreme windy weather conditions,\neven after the conducting of some heats, and if not more than 75% of the beach and or surf\nevents have been contested, no Grand Aggregate Point score or Competitor of the\nChampionships can be awarded.\n4.2.7\nAssignment of Positions: The number 1 position shall always be on the left\n(facing the water) for all starts other than events run parallel to the water when the number 1\nposition shall always be nearest the water. These number 1 positions do not change\nirrespective of the direction of the event.\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\n4.2.8\nDraws: The initial draw for heats and beach positions may be conducted at the\ndiscretion of the Chief Referee or be provided by the Scorers. Draws for positions in next\nrounds, quarters, semis and finals, are to be drawn under the direction of the Chief Referee by\na nominated Technical Official, usually the Chief Judge or be supplied by the Scorers.\nIf the redraw for the next round (heats, quarter final, semifinals or final) is not provided by the\nScorers, the redraw for heats, quarter final, semifinals and so on is determined by the draw\ntables set out in the Appendix A for the Random Draw for 8 or less, Appendix B for the Random\nDraw for 10 or less, Appendix C for the Random Draw for 16 or less, Appendix D for the Random\nDraw for 20 or less and Appendix E: for the Random Draw for 32 or less. The method used for\nthe draw will be as follows:\na)\nThe Chief Referee will be responsible for all draws for quarters, semis and finals\nwhere heats have taken place.\nb)\nThe Chief Judge will advise Recorders what random draw table to use (Appendixes\nA, B, C, D or E) based on the number of competitors in the heats, quarter final,\nsemifinals or final The Recorder will determine the draw position of the compet","quarters, semis and finals\nwhere heats have taken place.\nb)\nThe Chief Judge will advise Recorders what random draw table to use (Appendixes\nA, B, C, D or E) based on the number of competitors in the heats, quarter final,\nsemifinals or final The Recorder will determine the draw position of the competitors\nfor the next heats, quarter final, semifinals or final.\nc)\nAt the conclusion of each heat, the Recorder will write down the names of the first 8\ncompetitors in Heat 1 in their finishing positions from 1 to 8 on the Recorders pads\nand the same for Heat 2 recording the first 8 competitors in positions from 9 to 16\nthen in front of each name circled in pen the number that corresponds to that finishing\nnumber on the draw sheet from the Chief Judges specified pre-drawn column. The\ncircled number will be the competitors draw for the next round.\nd)\nTo be duly signed off by the Chief Judge if agreed such process was carried out\ncorrectly. A copy thereof to be forwarded to the Check Starter to correctly place each\ncompetitor in the correct position for the next round. The draw number must be\nindicated at the bottom of each record sheet.\nIt will be the responsibility of the Chief Referee to submit a new draw sheet for the competition\nor to use the pre-drawn sheets found at the back of this competition manual. Should there be\ninsufficient nominations for heats; draws for positions for finals may be conducted at the\ndiscretion of the Chief Referee.\nShould there be insufficient nominations for heats, draws for beach positions in semi-finals or\nfinals may be conducted by LSA or nominated officials and supplied to clubs.\nVacancies created by the disqualification of a competitor or team shall only be filled by the next\nplace getter participating in the same race.\nVacancies created in qualifying to further rounds of an event due to the withdrawal of a\ncompetitor or team shall only be filled by the next place getter who participated in the same\nrace.\nNote: Competitors must start the race from their allotted beach position.\n4.2.9\nCompetitor Limitations: The Chief Referee or Sectional Referee shall decide\nwhether events shall be conducted in heats, rounds, quarter-finals, semi-finals or straight out\nfinals. Only the Chief Referee may authorize changes to these maximum numbers with due\nconsideration for effective judging, environmental conditions, safety considerations and fairness\nfor all competitors.\n\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nEVENT\n3 x 1 km Beach Run Relay\nBeach Flags\nBeach Relay\nBeach Run\nBeach Sprint\nBoard Race\nBoard Rescue Race\nBoard/ Single Ski Relay Race\nDouble Ski Race\nIron Man & Woman Race\nNipper Bodyboard Race\nNipper Bodyboard Relay Race\nNipper Taplin Relay\nOcean M Lifesaver Relay Race\nOceanman/ Oceanwoman M Race\nReel Alarm Race\nRescue Tube Race (1 person)\nRescue Tube Rescue Race (4 & 2\npersons)\nRun/Swim/Run Race\nRun/Swim/Run Relay Race\nSingle Ski Race\nSurf Swim Race\nSurf Swim Relay Race\nTaplin Relay Race\nNote:\n\nNUMBERS / EVENT\nNumbers condition dependent\n16 Competitors in heats / 8 in final\n10 teams of 4 competitors in heats/ 8 in final\nNumbers condition dependent\n10 Competitors in heats/ 8 in final\n16 Competitors\n9 teams of 2 competitors in heats/ 8 in final\n16 teams of 3 competitors\n16 teams of 2 competitors\n16 Competitors\n32 Competitors in heats and final\n16 Teams of 3 competitors in heats /16 in final\n16 teams of 3 competitors\n16 teams of 4 competitors\n16 Competitors\n5 Teams\n9 Competitors/ 8 in final\n9 Teams of 4 competitors in heats/ 8 in final\n32 Competitors\n32 Teams of 3 competitors\n16 Competitors\n32 Competitors\n32 Teams of 3 Competitors\n16 teams of 4 competitors (3 for Masters)\n\nAll events not stating Nippers will also apply to Nippers events where applicable.\n\n4.2.10\nEliminations: To assist with the fair conduct of competition if there is an even\nnumber of competitors in a heat at least half the competitors who correctly complete the course\nshould progress to the next round of the event (e.g. if there are 16 starters in a race at least 8\nwho correctly complete the course should qualify for the next round of the event). If there is an\nuneven number of competitors in a heat at least half the competitors less one who correctly\ncomplete the course should progress to the next round of the event (e.g. if there are 7 starters\nin a race at least 3 who correctly complete the course should qualify for the next round of the\nevent).

Such extension to the time limit shall be\nadvised to competitors and Technical Officials prior to the commencement of the event. It is\nconsidered that an event has been finished when all the competitors have completed the event,\nor the event has been aborted (withdrawn) or when the time limit has expired.\nThe Chief Referee may declare an event finished if sufficient competitors or teams have\ncompleted the event, without D/Qs, prior to the time limit expiring or when the number of\ncompetitors required for subsequent rounds have qualified by completing the race without\ndisqualification, should time become of the essence to complete the competition.\nIn events requiring patients, any patient arriving at his buoy more than 5 minutes after the arrival\nof the first patient, or failing to reach their buoy within 10 minutes, will render his team\ndisqualified.\nWhere practicable, disqualifications due to the time limit being exceeded shall be advised to the\ncompetitor by the Chief Referee or Sectional Referee or the Course Judge.\n4.2.12\nReporting and Starting Times: Competitors shall advise their intention to start or\nwithdraw by reporting to the Marshal prior to the start of the event, to be marked off on the\ndraw sheet. Competitors or teams qualifying for subsequent heats/rounds, who wish to\nwithdraw, must advise the Marshal prior to the next draw being conducted. Competitors or teams\nmay be subject to a fine if they withdraw.\nEach competitor is responsible and shall ascertain the starting time to gain knowledge of\nconditions governing the particular event/s. Competitors shall be prompt in reporting to the\nMarshal before the start of each event. Competitors will not be allowed to commence in an event\nif they are late in reporting to the Marshal.\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\n4.2.13\nMarshalling: Competitors shall be marshalled, registered and entries checked by\nthe Marshal, allocated in heats and positioned according to the draw.\nFailure of competitors to present themselves properly attired and complete with satisfactory\nequipment when called by the Marshal, may render them liable to disqualification. These\ncompetitors shall be reported to the Chief Referee. It is the obligation of the competitors to be\non the starting line once marshalled and provided further that competitors warming up after the\nstart of the first heat do not interfere in any way with the conduct of any aspect of the competition.\n4.2.14\na)\nb)\n\nStarting of Events: Prior to the start a Marshall shall:\nPlace competitors in the order as drawn for all heats and or finals.\nAccompany competitors and their required equipment to the starting area and ensure\nthat competitors are positioned in proper order.\n\nPrior to the start of each race, designated Technical Officials shall:\na)\nCheck that all Technical Officials are in position.\nb)\nCheck that Competitors have swim wear and skull caps for a legal start.\nc)\nCheck that equipment and course markers are in position.\nA Technical Official (Check Starter/Break Judge) shall signal the Starter that the competitors\nare under the starters control. The process of starting events should commence with a signal\nor command that indicates Take Your Marks followed by a signal or command that indicates\nSet and then followed by a start signal or command that indicates Go. If, for any reason, the\nStarter must speak to any competitor after either command prior to the start signal or command,\nthe start process shall be recommenced.\nIf, for any reason, the Starter is not satisfied that all is ready for the start to proceed after\ncompetitors are Take your Marks, the Starter shall order all competitors to withdraw from their\nmarks, and recommence the start. While the Starter makes every attempt to affect a fair start,\nthe decision to Go on the start signal rests with the competitor or team. If there is no recall by\nthe Starter, Check Starter or Chief Referee, no protest or appeal shall be allowed on the start.\nNote 1:\n\nNote 2:\n\nThe duty of the Starter and Check Starter is to ensure a fair start. If the Starter or\nCheck Starter decides that a start is not fair, for any reason, including technical or\nequipment fault, the competitors shall be called back and start again. Competitors\nshall be disqualified if they commence a forward starting motion prior to the starting\nsignal. Involuntary movement by itself is not a disqualification. Anticipating the\nstarting signal and commencing a starting motion is a disqualification.\nThe Starter and Check Starter use their discretion in determining whether a\ncompetitor or more than one competitor has commenced a starting motion.\ncommonly, the early starting motion of one competitor causes movement by other\ncompetitors. Such movements are not a DQ of the other competitors.\n\nThe Starter shall:\na) Have sole jurisdiction over the competitors from the time of the start signal or command\nuntil the race has started.\nb) Position himself or herself so as to have full visual control over all competitors during the\nstart.\nc) Ensure that the start for all races is consistent and fair.\nd) Disqualify competitors for false starts (or in beach flags, eliminate competitors).\nWhilst every endeavour should be made by the Starter to effect an even start the decision to\ngo on the start signal entering the water in swim, craft and multi-discipline events rests with\nthe competitor or team providing there is no interference to other competitors. The competitor\n\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nentering the water in second or subsequent legs (in multi-disciplinary events) shall be deemed\nto be at fault if the progress","im, craft and multi-discipline events rests with\nthe competitor or team providing there is no interference to other competitors. The competitor\n\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nentering the water in second or subsequent legs (in multi-disciplinary events) shall be deemed\nto be at fault if the progress of a competitor approaching from the water is impeded.\nIf there is no recall by the Starter or the Check Starter(s) or the Chief or Sectional Referee, no\nprotest shall be allowed on the start. The Starters or Check Starters decisions on starts are not\nsubject to protest or appeal.\nStart lines may be established in the following manner and competitors must cross the start line\nto commence their race:\na)\nA designated line marked by a cord between two poles and/or with flags.\nb)\nA designated line drawn on the sand between two poles.\nc)\nA line of sight between two poles or straight line in the water not beyond waist depth\n(e.g. ski start), or as determined by the Starter or the Check Starter.\nIn events where a cord is used competitors toes shall be on or behind the line but parts of the\nbody may overhang the line.\nIn events where a line is drawn (e.g. Beach Sprint), toes and fingers shall be on or behind the\nline.\nIn board events where a cord is used, and the board is held by the competitor, a part of the craft\nmay be over the line but must be at right angles to the line or at an angle to accommodate\nprevailing conditions. In events where a board is placed on the beach it shall be placed flat on\nthe beach (i.e. no mounds underneath the board) at 90 degrees and with the nose of the board\non the shoreward side of the start or change-over line.\nIn boat and/or ski events, where a line of sight is used, the bow of the craft shall be on or behind\nthe line, and at 90 degrees to the line or at an angle to accommodate the prevailing conditions.\nThe first competitor to leave their position on the starting line mark after the command Take\nYour Marks and before the signal to commence shall be considered to have made a starting\nbreak infringement and a false start declared.\nThe first competitor who breaks will be disqualified except in beach flag events where that\ncompetitor will be eliminated. If one competitor false starts, others may follow. Any competitor\nwho follows is not deemed to have false started.\nUnfair False Start: Irrespective of whether a false start occurred, if in the opinion of the Starter\nor the Check, Starter, the start was not fair because of a technical defect or other matter not\ncaused by competitors the Starter must recall the competitors and recommence the starting\nprocess.\n4.2.15 Racing Patient Events: In all events with a racing patient (such as rescue tube\nrescue), should weather conditions warrant, the Chief Referee may allow any team members\nparticipating in that heat, semi-final or final, to take up any position anywhere within the confines\nof the arena to observe the patients progress and arrival at the buoys and advise his team\nmembers accordingly.\n4.2.16\nChange-Over (Tagging) in Relay Events: Unless otherwise provided (e.g. beach\nrelay) in relay events change-over shall be effected by a competitor \"tagging\" the next team\nmember. Tagging is defined as when the incoming competitor, using either hand, visibly touches\nthe on-going competitor either on the hand or any other part of the body. The on-going or\noutgoing competitor shall be positioned with his feet on or behind the change-over line.\nIn taplin, board, bodyboard and ski relay events competitors must commence the leg of the\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nevent from the (correct) position as allocated by the Marshall or Check Starter. If a competitor\ndoes not comply with this, the team will be disqualified.\n4.2.17 Completion of Courses: Competitors/teams must compete fairly and adhere to the\ncourses and the rules as detailed in this Manual or Entry Conditions Circular/s or as directed\nby the relevant official for the conduct of various events. Where available, electronic\nequipment (including video) may be utilised to assist the judging process.\nIf a competitor/team misses a turning buoy or turning flag they may, without penalty, alter their\ndirection and return by their most direct route to correct the course error and continue to the\nfinish of the event.\nIn events where it is required to cross a line to finish, should a competitor or team not correctly\ncross the finish line as prescribed in the relevant section for that event, they may recover and\ncorrectly re-cross the finish line to record their placing.\nOnce a competitor has been judged to have correctly crossed the finish line, they will be deemed\nto have completed that race. As such, a competitor will then not be permitted to then re-enter\nthe course to correct any previous race errors.\nWhere a competitor fails to correctly complete the prescribed course, compete fairly or in any\nother way breaches or fails to follow a rule in this manual they may be penalised or disqualified\nby the Chief Referee or Sectional Referee at their discretion.\n4.2.18\nFinish of Events: All events shall be judged visually or with the use of electronic\nequipment. Placing shall be decided by Finish Judges. Ties (dead heats) shall be declared as\nsuch. Finish Judges shall be positioned to ensure a clear view of the finish line. Where\nappropriate Finish Judges shall be placed in elevated positions.\nJudge 1 selects finishers 1 and 2; Judge 2 selects finishers 2 and 3; and so on, with Judges\nprimarily responsible for their corresponding number (that is, Judge 1 is primarily responsible\nfor finisher 1, as well as noting who finished second).\nAt the Chief Judges signal, placing discs shall be issued and/or names recorded. Competitors\nwill then proceed with the issued position finish disk to the Recorder to record their finish\nposition. Competitors must remain wearing their skull caps It should be noted that the competitor\ncannot hand their finishing disk to a second party (manager, coach or fellow compet","es recorded. Competitors\nwill then proceed with the issued position finish disk to the Recorder to record their finish\nposition. Competitors must remain wearing their skull caps It should be noted that the competitor\ncannot hand their finishing disk to a second party (manager, coach or fellow competitor, etc.)\nfor recording. Where available, Finish Judges may use video/electronic equipment to assist\nthem. Video playback is for use by appointed officials only.\nIn events such as skis and surf boats (wet finishes), competitors/teams/crews are deemed to\nhave finished when any part of the craft crosses the finish line, and competitor(s) are in contact\nwith the craft and other equipment, such as paddles, oars, etc. are retained as required by the\nevent rules.\nIn events where competitors are required to cross a finish line, the finish is judged on the chest\nof the competitor when crossing the finish line. They must cross the line on their feet in an\nupright position, i.e. not falling or diving across the line and if failing to do so correctly,\ncompetitors may recover and correctly re-cross the finish line to record their placing.\nCompetitors not correctly crossing the finishing line shall be marked as not finished, any\ncompetitor marked as not finished (i.e. Did Not Finish/ DNF) will not be eligible for any placing\nor points. Competitor must be notified as for disqualification.\nThe Chief Referee or Sectional Referee may declare an event finished if sufficient competitors\nor teams have successfully completed the heat or event, without disqualifications, prior to the\ntime limit for the event having expired, should time become the essence to complete the\ncompetition.\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nThe Chief Referee may authorize the wearing of electronic finish tags to aid the judging and\nrecording of races. Competitors must place tags as directed (e.g., around a specified ankle or\nwrist or placed on a designated part of their craft/surf boat). The result of such races shall then\nbe determined by the order of the finish of the tags across the finish line. In the event of failure\nof the electronic tags, all placings in a race shall be visually judged using normal methods.\n4.2.19\na)\nb)\n\nDead Heats: In the event of a dead heat the following shall apply:\nIn finals, unless otherwise provided, a dead heat shall be declared as such and trophy\nallocation shall be as decided by the Chief Referee.\nQualifying dead heat competitors in preliminary heats, quarter finals or semi-finals\nshall be entitled to compete in the next round or final unless otherwise provided.\n\n4.2.20 Disqualifications\" and Did Not Finish Classifications: Competitors or teams\nmay be disqualified from an event or from the entire competition. Where a competitor is\ndisqualified for any reason, in a heat or a final, the place he or she would have held shall be\nawarded to the competitor who finished next and all lower placing Competitors shall be\nadvanced one place.\nWhere a competitor is disqualified for any reason, the event results shall include a place or time\nfor the competitor.\na)\nDid not finish (DNF): Where a competitor crosses the finish line but does not finish\nan event for any reason, in a heat or a final, the place he or she would have held shall\nbe awarded to the competitor who finished next and all lower placing competitors shall\nbe advanced one place. Where a competitor does not finish an event, the event\nresults shall not include a place or time for the competitor.\nb)\nDisqualification from competition (D/Q): Examples of behaviour which may result\nin disqualification of individuals or teams from the competition, include:\n1. Refusing to fulfil the conditions of entry.\n2. Breach of the LSA code of conduct.\n3. The impersonation or use of unauthorised competitors.\n4. Activities resulting in wilful damage to the venue sites, accommodation sites or\nthe property of others.\n5. Abuse of officials.\n6. Acts of discrimination and racism.\n7.

Being absent at the start of an event.\n2. Infraction of the General Competitive Conditions for events or infraction of event\nrules.\n3. Competitors shall be notified of their disqualification from an event by the Chief\nReferee or appropriate Technical Officials, at the completion of the race.\nCompetitors shall not leave the designated competition area until dismissed by\nthe Chief Referee or appropriate Technical Official.\nd)\nIf an error by a Technical Official follows a fault by a competitor, the fault by the\ncompetitor may be expunged at the Chief Referees discretion.\n4.2.21 Team Managers/Team Coaches and Chaperones: Only registered Team\nManagers/Team Coaches and Chaperones may enter the competition arena to manage their\nteams, (note: no coaching is permitted). The Team Managers/Team Coaches and Chaperones\nmust wear their registration tag and wear the clubs competition skull cap.\nIf Team Managers/Team Coaches or Chaperones are involved with the removal of craft in\ncertain events, they are deemed to be a handler and they must comply with the conditions set\nout in par. 4.2.22 below.\n\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\n4.2.22 Handler: In certain events, especially ironman/woman and iron nipper and relay races,\na handler shall not be deemed to be a competitor but shall be required to:\na) Be a member of the same team as the competitor and be entered at the competition.\n(exemption may be given by the Chief Referee for a member of another team to be a\nhandler provided that the handler is entered at the competition). In nipper competitions\nthe team manager or coach may be a handler\nb) Wear a competition skull cap and shall be required to wear a distinctive high visibility\nvest as determined by LSA (or the relevant Event Organizer) if entering the water\nbeyond knee depth.\nc) Comply with all instructions of the Technical Officials.\nd) Make eve","m manager or coach may be a handler\nb) Wear a competition skull cap and shall be required to wear a distinctive high visibility\nvest as determined by LSA (or the relevant Event Organizer) if entering the water\nbeyond knee depth.\nc) Comply with all instructions of the Technical Officials.\nd) Make every effort to ensure that they, or the equipment that they are handling, does\nnot impede another competitor, otherwise their competitor may be subject to\ndisqualification.\ne) Hold the surf ski in a floating position as per the diagram or as directed by officials.\nf) Make every effort to ensure that they and the equipment they are handling do not\nimpede other competitors (otherwise disqualification of the competitor may result).\n4.3\n\nSWIMMING EVENTS\n\nSwimming ability is a prime factor in surf lifesaving. Rescue tube races are in fact \"simulated\"\nrescues, with swimming buoys substituting for patients. Surf swim races are straight-out tests\nof ability and encourage members to keep fit for their patrol work.\n4.3.1\n\nRescue Tube Rescue Race (4 persons)\n\n1.\nThe Course\nThe course layout shall be as per the diagram. The start and finish line shall be positioned 5 m\nfrom the waters edge. A further 5 m shore wards from the start/finish line a set of beach markers\n5 m apart and corresponding in colour to and lined up with each swimming buoy shall be\npositioned.\n\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nRESCUE TUBE RESCUE RACE (4 PERSONS)\n(Distances approximate only)\nNote: The beach setup relative to the positioning of the\nbuoys may be adjusted dependent on the sea conditions\n2.\n\nProcedure\na) The event shall consist of four competitors in each team a patient (racing), rescue tube\nswimmer and two rescuers i.e. carry/drag party.\nb) Competitors in the rescue tube rescue race event shall assemble in the marshaling area\nand when entries have been checked and buoy colours allocated, teams (i.e. all four\ncompetitors) shall then file into the competition area and proceed to their allotted position\non the start/finish line as follows: the racing patient stands on the start/finish line, the\nrescue tube swimmer stands in the allocated position on the shoreward side of the start\nline. The rescuers stand immediately in front of their allotted buoy markers facing the\nsea and on the shoreward side of the start/finish line. The rescue tube swimmer may\nhold or don the rescue tube, and may hold the swim fins in his or her hands. Fins may\nnot be worn prior to crossing the start line.\nc) On the starting signal the racing patients enter the water taking advantage of surf\nconditions, swim to their allotted buoy. On reaching their allotted buoy, the patient shall\nplace their forearm over the top of the buoy and then signal their arrival by raising the\nother arm to a vertical position whilst remaining in contact with the buoy. The said signal,\nsubject to all conditions being fulfilled, shall be the determining factor in judging the\npatients arrival at their buoy. The patient must then retire to the seaward side of the\nswimming buoy and await arrival of the rescue tube swimmer.\nNote 1:\n\nShould a patient swim to a wrong buoy and signal the team shall be\ndisqualified.\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nNote 2:\nNote 3:\n\nShould the patient swim to the wrong buoy and then correct himself and\nthen proceed to the correct buoy, before signaling, the team shall not be\ndisqualified.\nThe swimming buoy is described as the buoy only and does not include\nany attaching ropes or straps.\n\nd) The rescue tube swimmer shall await the patients signal and must start from the correct\nallocated position on the shoreward side of the start line and may have their toes on or\nbehind the start line. The rescue tube swimmer may wear the rescue tube neck strap\n(harness) and hold the rescue tube and swim fins in their hands or place them on the\nsand on the shoreward side of the start/finish line. The wearing of the swim fin/s prior to\nthe starting signal is not permitted.\ne) The swim fins and rescue tube shall comply with the specifications as set out in Section\n10: Facilities, Equipment Standards and Scrutineering Procedures.\nf) On the patients arrival signal, the rescue tube swimmer crosses the start/finish line, dons\nthe rescue tube harness (if not already being worn) and swim fins at their own discretion\nand swims seaward to make the rescue of their patient. The rescue tube swimmer swims\nto the left hand side of the designated buoy (viewed from the beach) to the awaiting\npatient on the seaward side of the buoy.\nNote:\n\nThe team shall not be disqualified if the rescue tube swimmer crosses the start\nline and then resumes the correct position to correctly await the arrival signal\nfrom their patient.\n\ng) The rescue tube swimmer and/or the patient secure the rescue tube around the patients\nbody and under both arms and clipped to an O-ring. The patient may assist with the\nsecuring and clipping of the rescue tube. The patient and rescue tube swimmer must\nremain behind the buoy line during the clip in process. With the patient clipped into the\nrescue tube, the rescue tube swimmer continues (clockwise) around the buoy towing the\npatient to the beach.\nh) Rescue tubes must be donned correctly, either with the loop over one shoulder, or over\nthe shoulder and across the chest at the competitors discretion.

A competitor who fails to gain a baton in\na run-through is thereby eliminated from the competition.\nb) Except for disqualifications or break eliminations no more than three competitors shall\nbe eliminated in each run-through of the first and second rounds of competition. In\nsubsequent rounds and at all quarter-final, semi-final and final stages of competition, no\nmore than one competitor shall be eliminated in any one run-through. If the snake/line\nelimination system is applied (that is in the first round of elimination) three competitors\nmay be eliminated.\nNote:\n\nWhilst the above provides for a maximum of two or three eliminations per runthrough, wherever practicable competition should proceed with a maximum of\none elimination per run-through.\n\nc) The specifications for Beach Flags (batons) are set out in Section 10: Facilities,\nEquipment Standards and Scrutineering, Par. 10.3\nd) There shall be a preliminary draw for positions and further draws after each round. In\nsemi-finals and finals there shall be a draw after each run-through takes place.\ne) In heats the Chief Referee shall determine whether one, two or three competitors are to\nbe eliminated in each run-through. In semi-finals and finals, no more than one competitor\ncan be eliminated in any run-through.\nf) At the discretion of the Chief Referee the eliminations may be conducted using the\nsnake/line elimination system. All competitors will form a single line and the first 16\ncompetitors will form the first heat. After each run-through the competitors qualifying\n(that is competitors with batons) will take up a position at the back of the snake/line\nwith the place in the line according to the numbered baton obtained.\ng) If it is apparent that a baton has been lost (in the sand) to competitors, the finish judge\nshall signal that the baton is lost and that the run through is finished. This signal shall be\ngiven either by whistle signal or by word. A run-off shall then occur only between the\ncompetitors involved in the search for the baton.\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nh) If two or more competitors hold the same baton and the finish judges are not able to\ndetermine which competitor's hand grasped the baton first, the finish judges shall advise\nthe Sectional Referee who shall decide whether there shall be a run-off between the\ncompetitors involved. If, after one run-off to determine who progresses in an event or to\ndetermine a final placing result and the competitors still cannot be separated, run-offs\nshall be continued until an elimination and/or placing result is achieved.\nNote: In the scenario of a lost flag or two competitors holding the baton and it cannot be\ndetermined who grasped the baton first and the snake/line elimination system is used, the\ntwo competitors will be placed in the line, i.e., no run-off.\ni)\nj)\n\nEach run-through or run-off shall be judged as a separate segment of this event and an\ninfringement in one","holding the baton and it cannot be\ndetermined who grasped the baton first and the snake/line elimination system is used, the\ntwo competitors will be placed in the line, i.e., no run-off.\ni)\nj)\n\nEach run-through or run-off shall be judged as a separate segment of this event and an\ninfringement in one run-through or run-off shall not be carried over and counted against\na competitor in a subsequent run-through or run-off.\nIf heats are conducted in Beach Flag events a minimum of four competitors must\nprogress from each heat into each subsequent round of the event unless there is a\ndisqualification or elimination of more than one competitor in the last run-through of the\nround.\n\n3.\n\nCompeting for Flags/Deliberate Impedance\na) A competitor may otherwise use their body to improve their position to compete for a\nbaton. A competitor may negotiate the shoulder and or body in front of an opponent, but\nmay not use hands, arms, feet, or legs to obtain or remain in this position. If a competitor\nlegally obtains this front position and maintains normal running action, the competitor\nbehind is obliged to go around the competitor in front. A competitor may cross over in\nfront of a slower competitor.\nb) Deliberate impedance is defined as the deliberate use of hands, arms, feet or legs.\nc) Any competitor who commits deliberate impedance on another competitor will be\neliminated from the event. If two or more competitors are guilty of deliberate impedance,\nthe competitor who first deliberately used arms, shoulder, hands, legs, or feet will be\neliminated.\nd) If it is deemed that a competitor has breached the relevant LSA Code of Behaviour\nand/or Competing Unfairly clauses contained in Section 2: General Competitive\nCondition, the competitor(s) involved may be disqualified.\n\n4.\n\nEffect of Elimination and Disqualification\na) Any competitor eliminated from the event shall retain the point score and/or placing as\nat the time in the event.\nb) Any competitor who is disqualified from the event shall lose all standing from the event.\nIn the event of disqualification from a medal or points round the competitor(s) eliminated\nfrom the event immediately prior to the disqualification shall be awarded that placing\n(except if that competitors elimination was the result of a disqualification in which case\nthe next prior competitor eliminated from the event through natural attrition will be\nawarded the medal or points).\nc) In Beach Flags events a protest against an elimination must be lodged within 2 minutes\nor before the next run through of an event begins (whichever occurs first). If a Beach\nFlag elimination protest occurs the Chief Referee will immediately consider the protest\nwithout delay before proceeding with the event. There will be no Appeal permitted on\nBeach Flag elimination protest decisions of the Chief Referee.\nNote 1: A Chief Referee is also authorised to refer a Beach Flag elimination protest\ndirectly to an on-beach Appeals Committee representative for decision based on\nthe processes and timings detailed above. No paperwork is required nor is a fee\npayable if this occurs.\n\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nNote 2: A competitor is permitted to protest and/or appeal against a disqualification\ndecision in Beach Flag events provided that correct processes are followed as\ndetailed in Section 9: Protests and Appeals of this Manual.\n5.\n\nProcedure\na) Competitors take their allotted positions, a minimum of 1.5 m apart at the start line.\nb) When directed by the Starter, competitors shall lie face down with their toes on the start\nline, heels or any part of the feet together, hands on top of each other with fingertips to\nwrists and with the head up. Elbows should be extended 90 degrees to the bodys\nmidline and hips and stomach must be in contact with the sand. The bodys mid-line\nshould be 90 degrees to the start line. Competitors may level, flatten, and compress their\nstarting area but no scooping or digging of the sand is permitted.\nNote 1: When flattening or compressing the sand a competitor is not permitted to create\nmounds or unreasonably alter the incline of the sand to assist their start.\nNote 2: Competitors are permitted to dig their toes into the sand at the start line by digging\nwith their hands or feet before lying on the sand or with their feet after lying on\nthe sand.\nNote 3: Competitors should not unreasonably delay the conduct of the event in preparing\ntheir start area and must comply with the direction of officials.\nc) The competitors shall then await the command competitors ready from the Starter.\nd) The Starter shall then give the set command \"heads down\". The competitors shall place\nany part of the chin on any part of their hands, whilst maintaining a straight head\nalignment with the rest of the body and maintaining the body and limb positions detailed\nin paragraph (b). The competitors shall then await the start.\ne) At the Starter's whistle blast the competitor shall get to their feet as quickly as possible,\nrun to the finish line and attempt to obtain a baton.\nf) Any competitor picking up two batons shall be disqualified from the event.\n\n6,\n\nThe Start\na) The Starter must position themselves so that they cannot be seen by the competitors\nwhen they place the whistle in their mouth.\nb) Any competitor who continues to disregard the Starters commands or instructions and\ndelays the start by taking an unnecessarily long time to prepare their start area, lie\ncorrectly on the sand, or by not putting their head down on the heads down shall be\neliminated.\nc) Any competitor lifting or moving after \"heads down\" and prior to the start signal has made\na starting break infringement shall be eliminated.\nd) The first competitor who breaks shall be eliminated. If one competitor false starts, others\nmay follow. Any competitor who follows is not deemed to have false started.\nNote:\n\nIf an error by an official or starting apparatus causes or precedes a false start by\na competitor the fault of the competitor shall be expunged, and","o breaks shall be eliminated. If one competitor false starts, others\nmay follow. Any competitor who follows is not deemed to have false started.\nNote:\n\nIf an error by an official or starting apparatus causes or precedes a false start by\na competitor the fault of the competitor shall be expunged, and the starting\nprocess recommenced.\n\ne) Should a competitor be disqualified or eliminated, the remaining competitors and batons\nshall be realigned with no re-draw of positions. The run-through is to continue until a fair\nstart is effected or until the quota of competitors needed for the next round is achieved.\nShould the disqualification or elimination occur for first place in the event there is no\nrequirement for the remaining competitor to complete the run-through.\n7.\n\nJudging\na) The Sectional Referee or their appointee shall position themselves to maintain overall\nsupervision.\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nb) The Starter, Check Starter, finish and/or course judges shall be positioned to undertake\ntheir respective duties.\nc) The finish judges shall reclaim the batons from the successful competitors and then set\nup the batons for the next run-through.\nd) In beach flags events a verbal protest against an elimination must be lodged immediately\nbefore the next run through (should it be the last run the time for a verbal protest is 2\nminutes) of an event begins (whichever occurs first). If a beach flag elimination protest\noccurs the Chief Referee will immediately consider the protest without delay before\nproceeding with the event. There will be no appeal permitted on beach flag elimination\nprotest decisions of the Chief Referee.\ne) Finish Judges shall be positioned a few metres behind the line of batons, to reclaim the\nbaton from successful competitors and to set up the batons for the next run-through.\nNote: A Chief Referee is authorised to refer a beach flag elimination protest directly to an onbeach Jury of Appeals representative for decision based on of the processes and timings\ndetailed above.

A start and finish line is drawn 5 m from the waters edge with\nend boundary markers on either side. A further 10 m shoreward from the start/finish line a set\nof beach markers 5 m apart and corresponding in colour to and lined up with each swimming\nbuoy shall be positioned. The teams reel, after being carried in from the marshalling area, shall\nbe positioned so that the teams marker peg is against the reels rear spreader bar.\n3.\n\nProcedure\na) The competitors in the reel alarm event shall assemble in the marshalling area and\nwhen entries have been checked and buoy colours allocated, the teams shall file into\nthe competition area and proceed to their allotted position, placing the reel so that the\nteams beach marker peg is against the reels rear spreader. Patients will be dispatched\neither by the Starter or Check Starter.\nb) Each beltman may arrange the belt as desired on the reel drum. The beltmen take up\npositions on the starting/finish line. The linemen and reelsmen sit flat on the sand 1 m\nbehind their reel. Provided the linesmen and reelsmen sit flat on the sand, they may\nface any direction they like. The interpretation of flat is both cheeks of the buttocks\ntouching the sand\nc) At the starting signal, beltmen standing fast facing reels, the linesmen and reelsmen\nrace to their reels and carry them to the beltmen on the start/finish line. Reels must be\nplaced so that any part of the reel is on the start/finish line. The beltmen don their belts\nand enter the water directly in front of their reels and aim their swim directly towards\ntheir respective patients and buoys. The beltmen must enter the water to knee depth\ndirectly in front of their respective beach position, before moving across to the left or\nright to take advantage of the prevailing sea conditions without impeding any other\nteam. Beltmen deliberately crossing another teams line will be stopped from taking\nfurther part in the race.\nd) Linemen shall follow their respective beltmen to the water to pay out the line. They may\ngo into the water as far as they wish. The team is immediately disqualified if the line\nbreaks during any part of the race.\n\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\ne) The patients shall be in a position distinctly touching or holding their respective allocated\nbuoys","to the water to pay out the line. They may\ngo into the water as far as they wish. The team is immediately disqualified if the line\nbreaks during any part of the race.\n\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\ne) The patients shall be in a position distinctly touching or holding their respective allocated\nbuoys opposite their teams respective beach position as drawn. The swimming buoy is\ndescribed as the buoy only and does not include any attaching ropes or straps.\nf) Only on making contact with the patient by the beltman who signals by raising one arm\nvertically may the patient let go of the buoy. Patients must not try to swim or draw the buoys\ntowards the beach while waiting for their beltmen. They must wait quite passively. A time\nlimit has been set because the competition must not lag, and patients are instructed not to\ndawdle when swimming out to their buoys but to hurry in order to get the event started.\nPatients must arrive within 5 minutes after the arrival of the first patient.\ng) On securing the patient at the buoy, the beltman shall signal. The beltmen may signal in any\nway they like. The linesmen must not pull or haul in any way but with their hands and arms.\nReelsman may reel in as he likes. Any stepping movement by the linesmen, forward;\nbackward or sideways whilst hauling in the beltman and patient, shall not be deemed a\ndisqualifying factor. Line over-winds shall not be deemed a disqualifying factor.\nh) The linemen and reelman then haul the beltman and patient to the beach. They may not\nhaul the line by taking hold of it and running, walking or moving back with it in hand. The\npatient and beltman must remain on their backs throughout the haul to the beach. The\nbeltman must be in contact with the patient until secured by the carry/drag party.\nNote 1:\n\nNote 2:\n\nA signal from anybody other than the reel alarm team will NOT be allowed\nto signify the beltmans arrival at the patient. Only a team member of the\nreel alarm team competing in the event may utilise any position within the\nconfines of the competition arena to observe the beltmans progress.\nIn the event of the line being exhausted during the pay-out, the reelman\nshall move down the beach and inform two of the linemen and return\nimmediately to control the reel. The two linemen shall obtain another reel\nfrom outside the arena and bring it into position (position means the reel\nmust be on the start/finish Line when paying out recommences). It shall\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nbe permissible for the belt to be removed from the second (new) reel,\nbefore this is brought into the competition arena. The two lines must be\njoined by using either a reef knot or fishermans knot.\ni)\n\nOn return to the beach, any two of the three linesmen must carry/drag the patient across the\nfinish line. The finish is judged on the chest of the first team member of the carrying party\ncrossing the start/finish line in an upright position on their feet. The patient is not permitted\nto assist the carrying party by walking or running.\nj) The two linesmen should continue to drag or carry the patient well past the finish line to\nassist with judging of other teams in the event. The 1st team to fulfil these conditions will be\ndeemed the winner. Teams must then immediately make their way to behind their respective\nreels without interfering with teams still competing in the event. Any part of the reel must be\non the finish line at the end of the race.\nk) The winners shall be the team which fulfils all conditions and with line and belt intact first\ncarries their patient past its respective reel between the adjacent reels on either side. The\nend teams may each finish between their respective reels and the adjacent reels on the one\nside, or the respective end boundary marker on the other side.

There will be an approximate one-meter space\nbetween each board and each ski so that competitors are not impeded by craft. Following\ncompetitor use the equipment will then be managed in the arena by the designated officials.\n2.\nThe course\nBuoys shall be laid out for the swim, board, and surf ski legs as indicated in the following\ndiagram.\nTo ensure fair starts and finishes, alignment of the start line and finish line to the buoys may be\naltered at the discretion of the Chief Referee, depending on the prevailing sea conditions. To\nencourage spectator, public, media and sponsor interest special audio and visuals may also be\nutilised including changeover and finish arches, large in-water turning buoys, special on-beach\nturning markers/flags and on-beach grandstands.\n\nOCEANMAN/ OCEANWOMAN M RACE\n\n(Distances Approximate Only)\nNote: The beach setup relative to the positioning of the buoys may be adjusted dependent on\nthe sea conditions.\nBuoy distances: The swimming buoys shall be positioned approximately 90 m from the waters\nedge and 50 m apart.\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nThe board leg buoys and surf ski leg buoys shall be positioned approximately 50 m and 100 m\nrespectively behind the swimming buoys. The board leg buoys should be approximately 55 m\napart and the surf ski buoys approximately 60 m apart, with the surf ski buoys having additional\nsmall marker buoy approximately 1 m from the apex buoys on the return side of the ski buoys\nto assist with ski turns.\nMarkers: A large turning marker (or two flags approximately one meter apart) is to be placed in\nthe centre of the beach at approximately knee depth water to the designate beach turning point\nat the half way of each leg of the race. In the event that there is no shallow water the marker\nshall be placed at the waters edge.\nTwo further beach markers approximately 35 m apart are to be placed on the beach directly\nbehind the turning markers to form a semi-circular run track to the finish/change line.\nFinish/Change line: The finish/change line is designated by a finish arch or twin flags placed\n5 m apart and in the centre of the arena and approximately 20 m (tide dependent) from the\nwaters edge. If a finish arch is erected the judging line shall be delineated by two flags on the\nincoming side of the arch.\nNote: For the Ocean M Lifesaver Relay event the finish/change line shall also be the\nchangeover line for team members in the event.\nStart line: The start line shall be approximately 30 m in length, centered on the swimming buoy\nnumber 1 approximately 10 m from the waters edge, and may be marked by poles at either\nend.\nOther than the initial starting swim leg competitors are not required to cross through the start\nline for the board and ski legs of the event.\nNote: Boards and Skis are to be placed where directed prior to the commencement of the\nrace.\nSwim course: The swim leg is conducted from the start line, around the first swimming buoy\nfrom left to right, return to the beach to round the turning marker(s) from right to left, then proceed\naround the second swimming buoy from left to right and return to the beach, past the first beach\nmarker, through the finish/change arch and past the second beach marker to commence the\nboard leg.\nBoard course: The board leg is conducted from the pick-up of the board on the beach, past\nswim buoy 1 on the outside (i.e. the paddler stays to the left of the swim buoy 1) and around the\nfirst board buoy from left to right, return to the beach passing swim buoy 1 on the outside (i.e.\nthe paddler stays to the left of the swim buoy 1). The turning marker is then rounded from right\nto left, and the board is paddled past swim buoy 2 on the outside (i.e. the paddler stays to the\nleft of the swim buoy 2) and around the second board buoy from left to right, return to the beach\npassing swim buoy 2 on the outside (i.e. the paddler stays to the left of the swim buoy 2) to\nreturn to the beach, past the first beach marker, through the finish/change arch and past the\nsecond beach marker to commence the ski leg.\nSurf ski course: The ski leg is conducted from the pick-up of the ski on the beach, past swim\nand board buoys 1 on the outside (i.e. the paddler stays to the left of the swim and board buoys\n1) and around the first ski buoy (and the marker buoy) from left to right, return to the beach\npassing the board and swim buoys 1 on the outside (i.e. the paddler stays to the left of the swim\nand board buoys 1).

A single ballot shall be undertaken prior to the\ncommencement of competition to determine the gender order for the legs of the event.\n2.\nThe course\nThe course shall be as per the as indicated in the following diagram.\nThe event commences with a 500 m run leg which shall be conducted from the\nstart/change/finish line located at the finish arch to a point 125 m across the beach, turning\nclockwise around two markers and returning to finish arch. The runner turns clockwise around\ntwo markers at the finish arch and then repeats the course and tags the swimmer who shall be\nwaiting on the finish side of the start/change/finish line.\nNote: Shoes may be worn at the discretion of the competitor in the run leg of the event.\nThe changeover tag between competitors in the Ocean M Lifesaver Relay shall take place in a\nzone between the finish arch side of the start/change/finish judging Line and a line\napproximately 5 m to outgoing side of the finish arch. At the discretion of the team the outgoing\ncompetitor is to stand with their feet on start/change/finish judging line or be on the finish arch\nside of the start/change/finish judging line within the changeover zone. The tag must take place\nwithin this zone.\nNote: The outgoing competitors hand may extend into the incoming side of the\nstart/changeover finish Line to effect the tag but the competitors feet must be on or\nwithin either end of the changeover zone at the time of the tag.\nThe event shall be concluded when the ski paddler completes the ski leg and passes the first\nbeach marker and through the start/change/finish judging line.\nNote 1:\n\nNote 2:\n\nIf the swim buoy distance is to exceed 90 m from the waters edge because of\nprevailing tide or surf or beach conditions, the Event Management Committee may\ndecide to use the two board buoys for the swim. In such circumstances competitors\nshall not complete an M shape swim course but shall proceed around both board\nbuoys without returning to the beach and then commence the M board leg.\nShould tide or surf or beach conditions make it impractical to set a suitable M shaped\nwater course, the Event Management Committee may also alternatively decide to use\nthe traditional Oceanman/Oceanwoman for the water legs of the event while retaining\nthe on-beach course for the event.\n\n\nSection 4 Surf Competition\n\nOCEAN M LIFESAVER RELAY COURSE\nNote: The beach setup relative to the positioning of the buoys may be adjusted dependent\non the sea conditions.\n\n4.8\n\nDISQUALIFICATION CODES FOR SURF EVENTS\n\nCode and Disqualification\n1.

A boat crew must commence each race with all five competitors.\nb) Boat crews will not be permitted to start in an event if they are","as boat crew) shall consist of five competitors, four of whom\nshall be rowers and the fifth shall control the surf boat by a sweep oar and shall be known\nas the sweep. A boat crew must commence each race with all five competitors.\nb) Boat crews will not be permitted to start in an event if they are late reporting to the\nmarshalling area.\nc) A boat crew absent from the start of an event shall be disqualified.\nd) Should a member of any boat crew become indisposed they may be replaced subject to\napproval of the Chief Referee, provided the boat crew member complies with the\nrequirements for team substitution as detailed in Section 2: General Competitive Conditions\nand Section 3: Section 3: Competition Entry Requirements\ne) Boat crews and Officials must leave the designated competition area when not competing\nor officiating.\nf) Unless specifically provided for, no artificial means of propulsion may be used in\ncompetition.\ng) Boat crews shall be dressed in accordance Section 2: General Competitive Conditions, par.\n2.8 Competition Attire. Boat crews may wear flotation vests.\nh) All boat crews must wear an approved aquatic helmet during competition unless the Chief\nReferee has issued a dispensation because of favourable conditions. Refer: Section 2:\nGeneral Competitive Conditions. Par. 2.8.2 Competition skull caps and helmets\ni) Should conditions alter during an event, the Chief Referee may reverse the initial decision\nfor the optional wearing of helmets and mandate that all boat crews must wear an approved\naquatic helmet in competition. A nominal wave height of 1 m is considered the maximum\nthreshold where surf helmets may be considered optional. Wave height is only one\nconsideration in assessing surf zone hazards (examples of others could include: a heavy\nshore break, littoral drift, shorter wave periods, wind strength and direction).\nj) A decision to make helmet wearing optional is subject to a documented risk assessment by\nthe Safety Officer, that determines an acceptably low risk level.\nk) Helmets should be presented in team colours and design.\nl) Helmets (or club skull caps if helmets are not worn required) securely fastened under the\nchin, must be worn on competitors heads at the start. A boat crew shall not be disqualified\nif the helmet or skull cap is lost after the start of an event if officials could identify that the\nboat crew correctly started and correctly completed the course.\nm) Boat crews are strongly recommended to wear PFD (refer Section 2: General Competitive\nConditions, par. 2.8.4)\nn) Handlers shall not be a boat crew member but shall be required to:\ni.\nBe members of the same club as the boat crew and be entered at the competition\n(exemption may be given by the Chief Referee for members of another club to\nbe handlers provided that the handlers are entered at the competition).\nii.\nWear a competition skull cap tied securely under the chin.\niii.\nWear a distinctive high visibility vest as required by competition organizers if\nentering the water beyond knee depth.\niv.\nComply with all instructions of the Technical Officials.\nv.\nMake every effort to ensure that they, or the equipment that they are handling,\ndo not impede another boat crew (otherwise the transgressing boat crew may be\nsubject to disqualification).\nvi.\nHandle the surf boats and/or oars and sweep oar as directed by the relevant\nTechnical Official.\n\n\nSection 5 Surf Boat Competition\n\nNote: Where applicable Section 2: General Competitive Conditions, Section 3: Competition\nEntry Requirements and Section 4.2 General Conditions of Surf Competition will apply\nto all Surf Boat races\n\n5.2.\nSURF BOAT LIMITATIONS\nThe Chief Referee or Sectional Referee shall decide whether events shall be contested in heats,\nrounds, quarterfinals, semi-finals or straight out finals.

The turning buoys should be set at a\nminimum of 350 m rowing distance from knee depth water at the low tide mark depending on\nprevailing","5.5.1 The Course\nThe course shall be as detailed in the diagram of the type of race to be conducted. The surf\nboat turning buoys should be of distinctive colours. The turning buoys should be set at a\nminimum of 350 m rowing distance from knee depth water at the low tide mark depending on\nprevailing surf conditions and should be set in such a position to allow the boats to clear other\ncourse buoys by taking a straight course to and from their respective turning buoys.\nThe turning buoys should be set to provide a course which is as fair as possible and which will\ngive all boat crews the same distance to row, regardless of which position they are allocated.\n\nSection 5 Surf Boat Competition\n\n5.5.2 Pre-Start\na)\nFor each type of race, the boat crews shall be marshalled by the Marshal/Chief Referee\nto their allocated positions on the beach near the waters edge.\nb)\nAt the appropriate time, i.e. 5-minute preliminary notice for a wet start, the Check Starter\nshall direct the surf boats float and hold their surf boats in their allocated positions\napproximately 23 m apart in readiness for a race start.\nc)\nStarts may be wet or dry and will be dependent on the type of race and decided by the\nChief Referee. When a dry start is used, coloured markers corresponding with the buoy\ncolours will be placed in line on the beach, approximately 10 m from the waters edge.\nA crew member from each boat crew shall line up behind the allocated marker in\nreadiness for a race start. The remaining four boat crew members plus a handler (if\nrequired) shall hold the surf boat either floating in the water or at the waters edge.\nd)\nThe Check Starter shall hold a hand flag aloft when the boat crews are in line and ready\nto race. At the discretion of the sweep, a boat may draw their surf boat back from the\nline if they so wish, provided the surf boat is stationary at the time of the start. If boat\ncrews disregard the directions of the Check Starter or Starter they will be disqualified.\ne)\nIf a boat crew has a problem prior to the start, the sweep may raise an arm to indicate\nthat the boat crew is not ready to race, whereupon, the Check Starters may lower their\nflags and the Starter may lower the gun, whistle or siren, horn or flag. Once the problem\nhas been rectified, the start process may recommence. A boat crew that disregards the\nfurther directions of the Check Starter and/or Starter, the boat crew will be disqualified.\n5.5.3 The Start: The Starter shall make every effort to ensure that all boat crews are given a\nfair and even start. However, the decision for the boat crew to in and away is ultimately the\nresponsibility of the sweep. Boat crews may not protest the start.\nIf the Starter or Check Starter is not satisfied that the start has been fair for all boat crews, the\nrace shall be recalled by way of a second shot from the gun, whistle blast or siren horn blast.\nIn a dry start, the boat crew member runs to the surf boat when the start signal is given. When\nthe boat crew member visibly touches the hull or gunwale of the surf boat (not the oars), the\nboat crew may board the surf boat and commence rowing. Failure by the runner boat crew\nmember to visibly make contact with the boat before the remaining boat crew boards will result\nin disqualification.\n5.5.4 The Seaward Journey\na)\nOn the starting signal, the surf boats shall be rowed to sea. Sweeps should endeavour\nto steer a straight course to their allocated turning buoy. Failure to steer a straight\ncourse to their allocated turning buoy may result in a penalty or disqualification if\nanother surf boat is impeded or disadvantaged by such action.\nb)\nDuring the seaward journey, if a surf boat is swamped and overturns, the boat crew\nmay right and empty the surf boat and continue the race. To achieve this, it may be\nnecessary for the boat crew to return the surf boat to shore. If a time limit has been\nadvised and it is clear that a restarting boat crew will not complete the course in the\nallowed time, the Chief Referee may withdraw the boat crew from the race to prevent\ndelays to the programme.\nc)\nDuring the seaward journey, lost or damaged surf boats and/or gear (e.g., oars,\nrowlocks, etc.) may be replaced by other club members. Club members may place\nreplacement surf boats and gear for collection at the waters edge by the boat crew\nand remove damaged or lost equipment to ensure that interference is not caused to\nother competing boat crews.\nd)\nAny member of any club or Technical Official authorised to be in the competition area\nmay assist in the removal of damaged or lost surf boats and/or gear from the\ncompetition area to assist in maintaining safe competition.\n\nSection 5 Surf Boat Competition\n\ne)\nf)\ng)\n\nNon club members may not recover lost surf boats and/or gear and place same on\nthe start line for re-use by a boat crew during a race.\nReplacement gear may be brought into the competition arena and placed adjacent to\nthe starting line as directed by the Chief Referee or relevant Technical Official.\nIf a boat crew runs aground while steering a straight line to their allotted turning buoy,\nthe Chief Referee may halt the race and re-run that heat or place the boat crew in a\nsubsequent heat or round of the race.\n\n5.5.5 The Turn: Turns are usually made from left to right (i.e., clockwise or right hand in).\nHowever, this may change at the discretion of the Chief Referee after giving due consideration\nto the sea and weather conditions applicable at the time of that round. All boat crews must be\ninformed of a decision to change from left to right to right to left. Failure to make the turn in\nthe correct direction shall result in disqualification.\na)\nThe turn shall be affected giving due consideration to other competing surf boats.\nThe turn should be kept as tight as is required to avoid impeding other boat crews.\nThis applies when approaching and departing the turning buoys (see diagram).\nImpeding another surf boat may result in penalty or disqualification.\nb)\nIf a surf boat overturns","sideration to other competing surf boats.\nThe turn should be kept as tight as is required to avoid impeding other boat crews.\nThis applies when approaching and departing the turning buoys (see diagram).\nImpeding another surf boat may result in penalty or disqualification.\nb)\nIf a surf boat overturns its surf boat after completing the turn and before crossing\nthe finishing line (or in the case of a dry finish, the runner completing the course),\nthe boat crew may continue the race after ensuring the safety of all boat crew\nmembers who rounded the buoys in the surf boat.\nThis is to be demonstrated by all boat crew members who rounded the buoys\nregaining physical contact with their surf boat before the boat crew crosses the finish\nline (or in the case of a dry finish, the runner completing the course). Once this\ncontact has been completed the boat crew may proceed to complete the race.\nc)\nOnly those boat crew members who rounded the buoy in the surf boat are eligible\nto assist their surf boat in finishing the race. Should a boat in a race cause another\nsurf boat to overturn, the Chief Referee shall decide whether the affected boat crew\nmay progress to the next round. However, there shall not normally be a re-run of the\nfinal in such circumstances.\n\nSURF BOAT TURNS AT BUOYS\n\nSection 5 Surf Boat Competition\n\n5.5.6 The Return Journey\na)\nAfter completing the turn, sweeps should make every effort to steer a straight course\nto the finish line. Failure to do so may result in penalty or disqualification if another\ncompeting boat crew is impeded or disadvantaged by such action.\nb)\nSurf boats taking a wave must keep clear of surf boats in front of them and may\npass other surf boats on either side. Failure to comply may result in a penalty or\ndisqualification if another boat crew is impeded by such action.\nc)\nShould a surf boat on the return journey, when close to the finish line, be stopped\nby grounding, this boat shall be deemed to have finished the race. This surf boat\nmay be allocated a placing as decided by the finish judges provided that the boat is\nnot full of water and is heading towards the finish line under control of the boat crew.\nd)\nAny surf boat that dislodges a judging stand to impede judging will be disqualified.\nIf one surf boat causes another surf boat to dislodge a judging stand, the matter\nshall be adjudicated by the Chief Referee whose decision shall be final and not\nsubject to protest.\n5.5.7 The Finish\nWet Finish: For a wet finish, the finishing line shall be a line of sight drawn between two red\nflags (or another colour/s) and as defined in Section 4: General Conditions of Surf Competition\nPar.4.2.18 as determined by the Chief Referee on poles positioned far enough apart to\ncorrespond with the number of turning buoys laid (see diagram) and to allow all boats to finish\nafloat. As an alternative to the above, there is also an option for dry starts and dry finishes in\nany combination with wet starts and wet finishes.\nLarge elevated surf boat position markers, in the corresponding surf boat buoy colours, may be\npositioned on the beach behind each start position to assist sweeps returning to the beach to\ndetermine their position relative to their start position. When it is not possible to provide a fair\ncourse over the full number of positions, the Chief Referee, at his discretion, may reduce the\nnumber of boat crews in each race, including the finals to improve the fairness of racing. If it is\nclear that the turning buoys are not parallel to the beach and therefore not fair for all boat crews,\nthe buoys may be adjusted immediately at the discretion of the Chief Referee.\nA wet finish placing shall be determined when any part of the hull of the surf boat crosses the\nfinish line under the control of the boat crew and properly equipped from the seaward side\nbetween the finishing flags or when a surf boat runs aground. The boat crew may recover a surf\nboat that has crossed the finish line not under control and/or properly equipped and then again\ncross the finish line correctly to record a finish placing result.\nDry Finish: A dry finish is determined when a boat crew member leaves the boat and runs to\ntheir allocated position marker and crosses the line adjacent to same. The boat crew member\nmay leave the surf boat at any time after the turn has been completed and must cross the line\nwhile remaining in an upright position on his feet.\nAn alternate to crossing the line to finish may be prescribed by the Chief Referee. In such\ncircumstances, the boat crew member leaves the surf boat as described and then is required to\ntouch the boat crews finish marker while remaining on their feet.\n\n\nSection 5 Surf Boat Competition\n\nSURF BOAT RACE OPTIONAL DRY START AND/OR FINISH\n(Distances approximate only)\nNote 1:\nNote 2:\nNote 3:\n\nUnder control is defined as a boat being in an upright position with\na boat crew of at least three members in contact with the surf boat\nand the surf boat moving in a direction towards the finish line.\nProperly equipped is defined as a surf boat equipped with, a\nminimum of three rowing oars or two rowing oars and a sweep oar\nwhich shall be in the surf boat or in the rowlocks.\nThe beach set up relative to the positioning of the buoys may be\nadjusted dependent on the surf and weather conditions.\n\n\nSection 5 Surf Boat Competition\n\n5.6 SURF BOAT RACE: WET START AND WET FINISH\n5.6.1 The Course\n\nSURF BOAT RACE: WET START AND WET FINISH\n5.6.2 Procedure\na) The Marshall/Chief Referee will place the boat crews with their surf boats near the waters\nedge directly in front of their respective buoy colour marker prior to the 5-minute preparatory\nwhistle.\nb) At the sounding of the 5-minute preparatory whistle by the Starter/Chief Referee the boat\ncrews will immediately commence readying themselves and their surf boats for racing\nc) At the sounding of the 1-minute whistle by the Starter/Chief Referee the boat crews will move\ntheir surf boats seawards into position so that the surf boats are sa","ory whistle by the Starter/Chief Referee the boat\ncrews will immediately commence readying themselves and their surf boats for racing\nc) At the sounding of the 1-minute whistle by the Starter/Chief Referee the boat crews will move\ntheir surf boats seawards into position so that the surf boats are safely under control and\nafloat in line with one another keeping a minimum 23 m distance between adjacent surf boat\nteams.\nd) When the boat crews are all more or less in line with one another for a fair start the Check\nStarters will raise their hand flag vertically if they are not in line, they will lower their hand flag\nuntil all the racing surf boats are all in line\n\nSection 5 Surf Boat Competition\n\ne) When the surf conditions are fair for all boat crews the Starter will start the race by\nwhistle/gun/klaxon or hand flags.

Commonly, the early starting motion of one\ncompetitor causes movement by other competitors. Such movements are not\na DQ.\nStart decisions by the Event Director, Starter, or Chief Referee (or Chief\nReferees designate) are not subject to protest or appeal.\n\n7.4\nMANIKINS\n7.4.1 Competitors surfacing the manikin: Competitors may push off the pool bottom when\nsurfacing with the manikin. Competitors must:\na) Break the surface with the manikin\nb) Have the manikin in a correct carrying position when the top of the manikins head\npasses the 5 m line (Manikin Carry, Rescue Medley, Super Lifesaver) or 10 m line\n(Manikin Carry with Fins)\nc) Not re-submerge after surfacing\nNote 1:\n\nThe competitor must break the surface of the water while holding the manikin\nwith at least one hand before the designated 5/10 m line. The competitor cannot\nswim underwater beyond the designated 5/10 m lines and must remain at the\nsurface with the manikin throughout the race beyond these lines.\n\nSection 7 Pool Competition\n\nNote 2:\nNote 3:\n\nNote 4:\n7.4.2\n\nSurfacing the manikin judging criteria applies only when the top of the manikins\nhead passes the relevant 5/10 m line.\nWhen judging the manikin carry, the competitor and manikin are treated as one\nunit/entity. The judging focus is on the competitors actions, their carrying\ntechnique, and the position of the manikin. Water flowing over the manikin is\nnot a judging criterion.\nSurface means the horizontal plane of the surface of a still water pool.\n\nCarrying the manikin\n\nNote: The manikin carry rules have been amended to remove the disqualification for carrying\nthe manikin on an angle towards the pool bottom or face down and to improve fair\njudging of events.\na) In events where the manikin is carried, the manikin (as patient) is presumed to be nonbreathing. Water over the face is not a judged criterion.\nb) Competitors must carry the manikin with at least one hand always in contact with the\nmanikin.\nc) The manikin may not be pushed a push is defined as the manikins head is forward\nof the competitors head.\nd) The manikin may not be gripped or grasped by the throat, mouth, nose, or eyes.\nGripping the manikins throat, mouth, nose, or eyes also applies to covering the\nmanikins mouth, nose, or eyes with the competitors hand, armpit, body and/or limb.\ne) The competitor and manikin are considered to be one unit and either must remain at\nthe surface.\nNote 1: Surface means the horizontal plane of the surface of a Stillwater pool.\nNote 2: If the competitor and manikin are both below the surface, it is a\ndisqualification.\nNote 3: If the competitor and manikin are both below surface as the result of the\ncompetitors final stroke/lunge to touch the turning or finish wall/edge or for a\nrelay exchange, it shall not","tillwater pool.\nNote 2: If the competitor and manikin are both below the surface, it is a\ndisqualification.\nNote 3: If the competitor and manikin are both below surface as the result of the\ncompetitors final stroke/lunge to touch the turning or finish wall/edge or for a\nrelay exchange, it shall not be a disqualification.\nNote 4: The manikin must be carried with at least one hand in contact with the manikin\nat all times and that the manikin must not be gripped or grasped by the throat,\nmouth, nose, or eyes. It is not permitted to carry the manikin with an arm over\nor around the throat (neck) of the manikin.\nf)\n\nCarrying the manikin judging criteria applies only when the top of the manikins head\npasses the 5 m or 10 m line.\nIn the 5 m start zone and in the changeover zones of the Manikin Relay, and the\nchangeover zone of the Lifesaver Relay event, competitors are not judged on carrying\nthe manikin criteria. However competitors need to maintain contact with at least one hand\nwith the manikin at all times including during the manikin exchanges.\nNote:\n\nAs with all events, the standard carrying the manikin criteria (defined in 3.3)\napplies to the final relay competitor at the finish of the Manikin Relay and\nLifesaver Relay events.\n\n7.4.3 Towing the manikin\na) In events where the manikin is towed, the manikin (as patient) is presumed to be\nbreathing. Before the tow, competitors must secure the manikin correctly within the\n10 m pick-up zone. Correctly means the rescue tube is secured around the body\nand under both arms of the manikin and clipped to an O-ring.\nb) Competitors may return back into the 10 m change over zone to re-secure the manikin\nprovided the manikins head has not passed the 10 m line.\n\nSection 7 Pool Competition\n\nc) Competitors may swim on their back, side or front and may use any kick or stroke\nwhile towing the manikin.\nd) Beyond the 10 m pick-up zone, competitors must tow the manikin correctly secured\nwith the manikin face above the surface of the water.\nNote:\n\nThe manikin towing rules have been amended. The previous requirement to\nsecure the manikin under both arms at the 5 m mark has been modified to\nsecuring the manikin within 10 m mark.\n\ne) The line of the rescue tube must become fully extended by the time the top of the\nmanikins head passes the 10 m line.\nf) Competitors shall be disqualified if the rescue tube and manikin become separated.\nCompetitors shall not be disqualified if the rescue tube slips from under one arm of\nthe Manikin during the tow, provided that the rescue tube was secured correctly at\nthe 10 m line and the face of the manikin remains above the water surface.\ng) Competitors shall be disqualified if the line of the rescue tube is or becomes wrapped\naround the Manikin as it is deemed to be shortening of the line.\nh) Competitors shall not be disqualified if the manikin rotates in the rescue tube as long\nas the manikins face remains above the surface of the water. In addition, the manikin\ndoes not need to be carried head first provided it was secured correctly at the 10 m\nline and the manikins face remains above the surface of the water.\nNote:\n\nThe manikin towing rules have been amended from the previous rules to remove\nthe disqualification for a manikin rotating within the rescue tube provided that the\nface remains above the surface of the water.\n\n7.4.4 Manikin handlers\na) A member of the competitors team assists as manikin handler in the Manikin Tow with\nFins and the Super Lifesaver events. With the Chief Referees approval, non-team\nmembers may act as handlers, provided they are registered in the competition in some\ncapacity.\nb) At the start and during the race, the manikin handler, using their hands positions and\nmaintains the manikin vertically and facing the wall at its natural buoyancy position\nanywhere within the allotted lane.\nc) Manikin handlers must wear a competition cap.\nd) Manikin handlers may not intentionally enter the water during the event.\n7.5\na)\nb)\nc)\nd)\n\nSEEDING\nSeeding shall be used.\nFor pool events, competitors times are required to be submitted for both individual and\nteam events. Competitors and teams shall be ranked according to the entry times.\nCompetitors for whom no times are submitted shall be considered to have the slowest\ntimes.\nPlacement of competitors with identical times and placement of those without times shall\nbe determined by draw.\n\n7.5.1 Seeding in heats: Where events are conducted as heats and finals (according to the\nentries received), competitors shall be seeded in heats according to the submitted times in the\nfollowing manner:\na) If one heat: it shall be seeded as a final and swum during the final session.\nb) If two heats: the fastest competitor shall be seeded in the second heat, next fastest in\nthe first heat, next fastest in the second heat, next in the first heat, etc.\nc) If three heats: the fastest swimmer shall be placed in the third heat, next fastest in the\nsecond, next fastest in the first. The fourth fastest shall be placed in the third heat, the\n\nSection 7 Pool Competition\n\nfifth in the second heat, and the sixth fastest in the first heat, the seventh fastest in the\nthird heat, etc.\nd) If four or more heats: the last three heats of the event shall be seeded in accordance\nwith (c) above.

The\nautomatic officiating equipment must be activated by the Starter and must provide easy\ndigital readings of competitors times.\n\nSection 7 Pool Competition\n\nb) Times recorded by automatic officiating equipment shall be used to determine the\nwinner and all placings, and the time applicable to each lane. Results shall be recorded\nto 1/100 of a second.\nc) The placing and times determined by automatic officiating equipment shall have\nprecedence over the decision of Judges and timekeepers. If the electronic equipment\nbreaks down or fails, or if a competitor has failed to activate it, the decisions of the\nhuman timekeepers shall be official.\nd) In addition to the electronic timekeeping, a minimum of two timekeepers per lane are\nrequired.\n7.6.2 Manual time keeping and officiating\na) In LSA-sanctioned lifesaving competitions where automatic officiating equipment is\nunavailable, the time of each competitor must be recorded by three timekeepers. There\nshall be two additional timekeepers designated, either of whom shall be directed to\nreplace a timekeeper whose watch did not start or stopped during an event, or who for\nany other reason is not able to record the time.\nb) Watches are started when the starting signal is given and stopped when the competitor\ntouches (clearly visible to the timekeeper) the finish wall/edge with any part of the\ncompetitor's body.\nc) With three timekeepers, where two of them have the same time, this time shall be\nconsidered official. If the three timekeepers differ, the middle time shall be official. If\none watch fails, the average of the other two times shall constitute the competitors\nofficial time.\nd) If the order of finish indicated by the times recorded by manual timekeepers does not\ncoincide with the order of finish determined by the Finish Judges, the Finish Judges\nplacings prevail. The times assigned to the competitors involved shall be identical. For\nexample, if two competitors are involved, the times assigned shall be the sum of their\nindividual times divided by two.\n7.7\n\nTECHNICAL OFFICIALS\n\nTechnical Officials ensure that events operate fairly and within LSA rules and procedures.\nThey also assess whether competitors technique complies with specific event rules and must\nbe positioned to ensure they have a clear view of the lane they are judging.\n7.8 SOUTH AFRICAN RECORDS\nLSA maintains a register of all South African records.

Patients may not release the crossbar before grasping the throw line with the other\nhand.\nAs long as patients remain entirely within their designated lane and do not release their\ngrasp on the crossbar prior to grasping hold of the line, they may use their foot or other\npart of the body to manoeuvre the throw line within their lane to a position where they\ncan grasp the line with their hand.\nNote:\n\nThe patient can slide their hand anywhere along the bar but must be grasping\nthe bar when touching the line with any part of their body and when grasping\nthe line.\n\ne) Pull through the water: While being pulled to the edge, patients must be on their front\ngrasping the throw line with both hands. Patients may not climb the throw line handover-hand. For safety reasons, patients may release the line with one hand for the sole\npurpose of touching the wall/edge. This will not result in disqualification.\nPatients may wear swim goggles.\nf) Throw zone: Throwers must remain on the deck and in their allotted lane, poolside of\na clearly defined line 1.5 m from the pool edge. If there is a raised portion of the\npoolside, the line shall be 1.5 m back from the deck side of the raised portion.\nThrowers who exit the throw zone while pulling the patient or prior to completion signal,\nshall be disqualified. Throwers must keep at least one foot wholly within the inside\nedge of the throw zone, either on the ground or in the air above the throw zone. Any\n\nSection 7 Pool Competition\n\npart of the throwers feet may cross over the front of the pool edge of the throw zone\nwithout penalty.\nThrowers may reach to retrieve a line dropped outside the throw zone as long as they\nmaintain at least one foot wholly within the throw zone, and that there is no interference\nwith another competitor. Throwers who enter (or fall into) the water shall be\ndisqualified.\ng) Time limit: Throwers must make a fair throw and pull the patient to the finish wall/edge\nwithin 45 seconds.\nThrowers who fail to get the patient to the finish wall/edge before the 45-second\nacoustic completion signal shall be designated as Did Not Finish (DNF).\n2.\n\nEquipment\na) Throw line: See Section 10: Facilities and Equipment Standardsand Scrutineering\nProcedures. The throw line must be between 16.5 m and 17.5 m in length. Competitors\nmust use the throw lines supplied by organisers.\nb) The rigid crossbar is positioned on the surface across each lane 12.5 m from the\nstarting end of the pool. A tolerance of plus 0.10 m and minus 0.00 m in each lane is\nallowed.\n\n3.\nDisqualification\nIn addition to the General Rules in Section 2: General Competitive Conditions and those\noutlined in par. 7.2 through 7.4, the following behaviour shall result in disqualification:\na) Line Thrower executing practice throw(s) (DQ58).\nb) Patient not keeping a grasp on the crossbar when grasping the line for the pull to the\nfinish wall/edge. (DQ51).\nc) Patient grasping the throw line outside the lane (DQ54).\nd) Patient not on his or her front while being pulled to the finish wall/edge (DQ55).\ne) Patient not holding the throw line with both hands while b","a grasp on the crossbar when grasping the line for the pull to the\nfinish wall/edge. (DQ51).\nc) Patient grasping the throw line outside the lane (DQ54).\nd) Patient not on his or her front while being pulled to the finish wall/edge (DQ55).\ne) Patient not holding the throw line with both hands while being pulled to the finish\nwall/edge (patient may release the line with one hand for the sole purpose of touching\nthe wall/edge) (DQ56).\nf)\nPatient climbing the throw line hand-over-hand (DQ57).\ng) Line Thrower exiting the throw zone at any time after the start and before the 45second acoustic completion signal (DQ52).\nh) Patient exiting the water before the 45-second acoustic completion signal (DQ53).\ni)\nFailure to touch the finish wall/edge (DQ15).\n7.10.14 2x2 Rescue Ball Rescue Relay Nippers (U/12 Combined and U/14 Combined)\n\n1.\nEvent Description\nTeams consist of four competitors - two throwers who shall rescue two patients, one by one,\nusing a lifesaving ball within a time limit of two minutes twenty seconds (2:20).\n\nSection 7 Pool Competition\n\nNote: U/9 and U/10 nippers cannot participate in this event.\nTeams compete in the U/12 combined (U/11 and U/12) age group and U/14 combined (U/13\nand U/14) age group. This is an optional combined event for boys and girls and no restriction\non gender participation\nAfter an acoustic signal, the first thrower (who is located in the drop zone) throws the ball to\none of the patients located in the water. The first patient grasps the ball/net, ducks under the\nrope or demarcation line and is towed to the finish edge where he touches the hand of the\nthrower. After that, the second thrower uses the same procedure to save the second patient\n(only one ball per team). When the second patient touches the hand of the second thrower,\nthe event is completed and the watches are stopped.\nAGE GROUP\nU/12 Combined\nU/14 Combined\n\nDISTANCE\n10 m\n12 m\n\nOptional combined event for boys and girls and no restriction on gender participation\nFor this event any numbers of throws are permitted within the time limit, but the first patient\nmust be rescued by the first thrower and the second patient must be rescued by the second\nthrower. The throwers can help each other, except during the throwing of the ball and the\npulling of the patients. While helping each other, they are not allowed to interfere with any\nother teams\nNote: It is not necessary for the patients to touch the finish edge prior to touching the hand\nof the thrower.\n2.\nEquipment\nEquipment to be used is a lifesaving ball, net and rope. The competitor is not allowed to\nchange the composition or size of the material. It is also forbidden to make knots in the rope.\nSee Section 10: Facilities, Equipment Standards and Scrutineering Procedures. Competitors\nmust use the lifesaving ball, net and rope supplied by organisers.\n3.\nPool: Drop Zone and Roof\nDrop zone: The drop zone is delimited by two parallel lane ropes 2.5 m apart, fixed\nperpendicular to the width of the launch zone. The drop zone is also delimited by a\ndemarcation line which is fixed right angled to the lane ropes in 12 m distance for the combined\nU/14 and in 10 m distance for the combined U/12 from the launch zone.\nThe ceiling of the swimming pool: The distance between the launch zone and the ceiling of\nthe pool shall be of 7 m at the minimum. The ceiling is to be considered as a dead obstacle,\nthis means that if the ball touches the ceiling and later falls into the drop zone, the throw is to\nbe considered valid.\nBetween competitors lanes there shall always be one free lane. The two border lanes must\nalso be free.\n4.\nPreparation and Start\nOn the first whistle, the competitors (i.e. throwers and patients) step into the throw zone.\nBoth patients enter the water and are located behind the rope (drop cord) or demarcated line\nin the lane allocated to the team.\nBoth throwers position themselves on pool deck, in their lane and prepare the lifesaving ball\nand rope. The preparation of the ball and the roll up of the rope is the responsibility of the\nthrowers who can be assisted in this phase only (by team members) prior to commencement\nof the event. No further help is then allowed. The thrower is permitted to hold the rope and the\nball as desired. The residue of the rope can be left on the ground.\n\nSection 7 Pool Competition\n\nAt the second whistle, throwers take their position for the start without undue delay. When\nall competitors have assumed their starting positions, the starter shall give the command\nTake your marks When the throwers and the patients are stationary, the Stater gives the\nacoustic starting signal.\nOn the acoustic starting signal the thrower throws the ball, but is forbidden to kick the ball\nwith the foot (i.e. shoot). It is also forbidden to use devices which effect an elongation of the\nlevel arms, which facilitate the rolling up or the hold of the rope or which in any way facilitate\nthe throwing. The wearing of gloves shall not be permitted.\n5.\nThrowing Conditions\nThe throwers may launch the ball as they like. The ball must not be kicked by foot. Any number\nof throws within the time limit is permitted.\n6.\n\nValidity of Throws\na) If a throw falls outside of the drop zone it is not valid.\nb) If the ball touches the lane rope, the ceiling or another object (except the person) and\nthen falls into the drop zone, the throw is valid.\nc) If the ball goes outside of the drop zone at any time the throw is not valid.\n\n7.\nGrasping the Ball/Net by the Patient\nThe ball/net may only be grasped by the patient after the ball has touched the water correctly\nin the drop zone. If the ball is thrown too far so that the patient cannot reach it but in the drop\nlane, the thrower is allowed to pull the ball towards them to enable the patient to grasp it. The\npatient is permitted to let the rope pass through his hand (as the thrower pulls the rope in) until\nthe ball/net is grasped. Waiting patients may not under any circumstances catch a ball which\npasses above their head and may","lowed to pull the ball towards them to enable the patient to grasp it. The\npatient is permitted to let the rope pass through his hand (as the thrower pulls the rope in) until\nthe ball/net is grasped. Waiting patients may not under any circumstances catch a ball which\npasses above their head and may not touch a ball that falls out of the drop zone. Further, the\npatient cannot touch the rope until the ball has landed and is not permitted to pull the ball\ntowards their self.\n8.\nThe Rescue\nThe patient must remain in contact with the ball/net with at least one hand. Climbing over the\ndemarcation line rope and pulling it towards to themselves shall result in disqualification.\nNote: It is clarified that whilst the patient must remain in contact with the ball/net with at least\none hand, the patient may move a free arm to assist in the rescue process.\nThe patients are not allowed to lose the ball/net. If a patient does lose the ball/net the patient\nshall return behind the demarcation rope and wait for another throw of the same thrower.\nWhen the first patient has been successfully rescued, the second thrower proceeds to rescue\nthe second patient as described in these rules. The first thrower may assist the second rescuer\nin the changeover of equipment and fix the rope around the ankle.\nNote: When not using the rope, net and ball the throwers must take care not to interfere with\nany other team in the competition. If interference occurs the offending team may be\ndisqualified and the innocent team shall be permitted to restart the complete event.\n9.\nParticular Conditions\nIf the thrower falls into the pool, the thrower is allowed to climb out and continue. However, no\none can assist the thrower to climb out of the pool. If the thrower throws the ball in the lane of\nanother competitor, thereby causing an entanglement with another competitors rope or ball\nthe offending thrower may continue the event if time permits and the equipment is untangled.\nThe innocent competitor, however, shall be permitted to restart the complete event. If the\nentanglement occurs in a neutral lane, both throwers should free their lanes and continue if\ntime permits. In this case a new start is not allowed.\n\nSection 7 Pool Competition\n\n10.\nTimekeeping\nThe watches are started at an acoustic start signal. The time is stopped when the acoustic\nsignal is given after the two-minute twenty seconds time has elapsed before the second\npatient touches the hand of the second thrower. The teams who have not rescued the two\npatients during the official time shall be designated as Did Not Finish (DNF).\n11.\nDisqualification\nIn addition to the General Rules in Section 2: General Competitive Conditions and those\noutlined par. 7.2 through 7.4, the following behaviour shall result in disqualification:\na) A thrower kicking the ball instead of throwing. (DQ 62)\nb) A patient climbing over the demarcation rope. (DQ 64)\nc) A waiting patient grasping a flying ball or touches the rope prior to the ball landing. (DQ\n65)\nd) Any patient losing contact with the ball/net and not returning to behind the 10 m/12 m\ndemarcation line. (DQ 66)\ne) The first patient not staying within the pool in their lane until completion of the event.\n(DQ 67)\nf) A team receiving outside assistance.

A team shall not be\ndisqualified if Teams skull cap is lost after the start of an event provided that officials\ncan identify that the competitor correctly completed the event.\nNo other personal belongings or equipment are permitted in the competition arena\n(e.g., watches, phones or any other communication device, goggles, masks, fins).\n\nSection 8 Simulated Emergency Response Competition\n\nm)\n\nTeams may be required to remove jewellery which might cause harm to the rescuer or\npatient.\nJudges scores are not subject to protest.\n\n8.1.1 Security and lock-up\nBefore the start and throughout the competition, teams are isolated in a secure lock-up\narea out of sight and sound of the competition arena. The scenario, actors, and any\nequipment shall be secret until Teams are locked up. After competing, a team may observe\nsubsequent teams compete. Teams in lock-up are not permitted to see or communicate with\nanyone who is not also in lock-up. Any device that would allow such communication is\nprohibited.\n8.1.2 Competition start\nOne at a time, teams are escorted from lock-up to the pool where, following an acoustic\nsignal, they are confronted with patients in various locations who need various types of\nassistance.\nActors will begin their patient simulations immediately prior to the acoustic starting signal,\nand as the team enters the competition area. At the acoustic signal Teams respond to the\npatients in any manner they wish within the time limit.\n8.1.3 Competition arena\nThe Simulated Emergency Response Competition may be held in a variety of indoor and\noutdoor aquatic environments. The competition arena shall be clearly defined to all teams in\nadvance. There shall be a clear indication of the location of both entry and exit points from\nthe scenario area (e.g., which pool sides can be used). Teams shall be advised in advance if\nthere are pool steps in the entry or exit area which may be removed or used. Unless\notherwise advised, Teams shall assume that the conditions in the competition arena are as\nfound. When electronic timing is available, it must be used as a countdown clock for teams\nand spectators.\n8.1.4 Situation scenarios\nSimulated emergency scenarios, secret until the start of the competition, shall be designed\nusing one or more of the following approaches:\na)\nAn amalgam of single or multiple-person situations which are related.\nb)\nA group of people involved in a number of situations which relate to a common\ntheme, such as a pool party or an over-turned crowded boat.\nc)\nA number of groups of people in a number of multiple themes.\nSimulated emergencies shall be staged as realistically (and as safely) as possible, and not\ntest the Teams imagination. For example, a situation in which an actor complains of burned\nhands should be staged with simulated evidence of a fire, or electrical wire, or chemicals.\n(Real fire, live wires, or actual chemicals shall not be used.)\n8.1.5 Patients, manikins and bystanders\nPatients shall be role-played by actors who present different problems necessitating different\ntypes of aid. Patient types may include simulated non-swimmers, weak swimmers, injured\nswimmers, and unconscious patients. In addition, teams may be confronted by resuscitation\nmanikins in the role of patient as well as by bystanders and swimmers.\nThe role-playing may evolve (e.g., a conscious patient becomes unconscious) during the\ncourse of the scenario providing that marks reflect the change, that there is consistent timing\nin the change, and that the change is consistent for every team throughout the competition.\n\n\nSection 8 Simulated Emergency Response Competition\n\nTeams shall be notified before the start if patient type is to be signified by a symbol (e.g., a\nred/black cross on forehead indicating unconsciousness). Teams shall treat manikins as\nnon-breathing, pulseless patients.\nNote 1:\nNote 2:\nNote 3:\n\nA bystander in a competition is not in immediate danger.\nOnly simulated CPR should be applied to live human patients that are\ndesignated as being non-breathing, pulseless patients.\nCPR beyond diagnosis and the simulation of 2 rescue breaths will NOT be\nrequired on live patients\n\n8.1.6 Equipment\nTeams may use all material and equipment available within the competition arena. Teams\nmay not bring their own equipment into the competition arena.\n8.1.7 Start and timekeeping\nAn acoustic signal will indicate the start and finish of each teams emergency response.\n8.2 PRINCIPLES OF RESCUE\n8.2.1. Lifesaver versus lifeguard response\nSERC teams are expected to respond as a group of four individual lifesavers acting in a\ncoordinated team under the direction of a team leader.\nUnlike lifeguards who often work as part of well-trained teams in controlled aquatic\nenvironments, lifesavers must be prepared to respond appropriately in unexpected\nemergencies","ed to respond as a group of four individual lifesavers acting in a\ncoordinated team under the direction of a team leader.\nUnlike lifeguards who often work as part of well-trained teams in controlled aquatic\nenvironments, lifesavers must be prepared to respond appropriately in unexpected\nemergencies without benefit of specialised equipment, back-up, or established procedures\nand communications systems. In such circumstances, the personal safety of the lifesaver is\nparamount at all times and this shall be reflected in the marking sheets.\nTeams apply the following basic rescue steps:\na)\nRecognition of a problem\nb)\nAssessment of the situation\nc)\nPlan a course of action to overcome the problem\nd)\nAction to effect the rescue\ne)\nCare of the patient\nWhen assessing the situation, teams consider:\na)\nCapabilities of the rescuer\nb)\nNumber of patients\nc)\nPosition of the patients\nd)\nCondition of the patients (e.g., non-swimmer, weak swimmer)\ne)\nRescue aids (equipment) available\nf)\nConditionsprevailing (e.g., water depth, entry and landing points)\nOn the basis of their assessment, teams plan a course of action which may involve:\na)\nSeeking assistance\nb)\nOrganising assistance\nc)\nInforming an available helper\nd)\nGathering any appropriate aids or equipment\ne)\nPerforming the rescue as necessary\nThe plan should establish control of the situation and aim to preserve as many lives as\npossible. The management of a rescue of multiple patients presents rescuers with choices.\nIn brief, rescuers should manage the situation as follows:\na)\nMobilise the mobile\nb)\nSecure the safety of those in imminent danger\nc)\nRecover and resuscitate those in need of continuous care\n\n\nSection 8 Simulated Emergency Response Competition\n\nThe mobile may include those capable of assisting themselves to safety. Those in imminent\ndanger may include non-swimmers and injured swimmers. Those in need of continuous care\ninclude unconscious, non-breathing, or suspected spinal-injured patients.\nWhen a suitable plan has been devised it should be put into action promptly. Teams should\nbe alert to changes in the situation and adapt their plan of action to respond to such\nchanges.\nWhen carrying out a rescue Teams must remember:\na)\nRescue from a position offering greatest safety to oneself\nb)\nThe management of rescue principles\nc)\nApproach patients with extreme caution\nd)\nAvoid direct personal contact with conscious patients\nIf entering the water is inevitable, Teams select the most effective techniques for the\nsituation without endangering their own life in any way.\nIt is important that Teams clearly show their intentions and actions to the Judges.\n8.3 JUDGING AND MARKING\nThe marking sheets shall be prepared with one Judge marking the entire scenario while the\nothers judge the handling of the individual patients. One Judge per patient is recommended.\nBefore the competition start, Judges shall be briefed on the situation scenarios, scoring\nprocedure and marking priorities.\nA Judge shall be assigned to a patient or group of patients and assess all teams in that part\nof the scenario for the entire competition.\n8.3.1 Marking system\nThe marking system used in this competition allows Judges to use their skill in assigning\nmarks and provides for a competitor offering an appropriate but unanticipated rescue\nresponse. In allocating marks, Judge(s) consider the following:\na) patient type\nb) patients distance from safety\nc) equipmentavailable and used\nd) speed of assessment\ne) priority given\nf) quality of action/task\ng) patient care\nEarly and accurate recognition of the patients problem(s) is the essential first step to\nsuccess in this competition. Successful recognition is closely related to the quality of the\npatient simulation and staging of the incidents.\na) Scoring shall reward the teams accurate assessment of which patients take\npriority. The teams assessment of which patients take priority will depend on the\nnature of the emergency. For in-water patients, teams should follow these patient\npriorities in determining whom to help first: Weak swimmers and others who are\nmobile\nb) Patients in imminent danger: non-swimmers and injured swimmers\nc) Patients requiring continuous care: unconscious, non-breathing, suspected spinalinjured patients.\nSpecific aspects of the scenario may be weighted to provide higher scores for a rescue\nperformance requiring a greater degree of skill and judgement.\nSee sample score sheets at the end of this section. These score sheets are samples only.\nUnique and competition-specific score sheets are designed for each championship.\nScenarios, marks and weighting will vary.\n\n\nSection 8 Simulated Emergency Response Competition\n\nIn addition, consult the SERC Guide for Coaches, Teams, Judges and Officials posted at\nwww.ilsf.org.\n8.3.2 Disqualification\nIn addition to the General Rules in Section 2: General Competitive Conditions and the\nGeneral conditions for Simulated Emergency Response Competition Par. 8.1, the following\nbehaviour may result in disqualification:\na) Receiving outside assistance, direction, or advice (DQ 7).\nb) Taking any telecommunication device into the security area (DQ 8).\nc) Using any equipment not provided as part of the competition (DQ 9).\nd) Teams who verbally or physically abuse a patient may be assigned a penalty or\ndisqualified (DQ 10).\n8.4\n\nDISQUALIFICATION CODES FOR SERC\n\n1.\n2.\n\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\n6.\n7.\n8.\n\nCode and Disqualification\nNot completing the event in accordance with the event\ndescription or general rules.\nA competitor or team may be disqualified if a competitor,\nteam or handler is deemed to have competed unfairly.\nExamples of competing unfairly include:\n committing a doping or doping-related infraction\n impersonating another competitor\n attempting to defeat the ballot or draw for events or\npositions\n competing twice in the same individual event\n competing twice in the same event in different teams\n purposely interfering with a course to gain advantage\n jostling or obstructing another competitor handler so as","ng another competitor\n attempting to defeat the ballot or draw for events or\npositions\n competing twice in the same individual event\n competing twice in the same event in different teams\n purposely interfering with a course to gain advantage\n jostling or obstructing another competitor handler so as to\nimpede his or her progress\n receiving physical or material outside assistance (other\nthan verbal or other direction)\nTeams may not be permitted to start in an event if they are\nlate reporting to the marshalling area.\nA competitor or team absent from the start of an event shall\nbe disqualified except for the final.\nActivities that result in wilful damage to the venue sites,\naccommodation sites or the property of others will result in\ndisqualification of the individuals and teams involved from\ncompetition.\nAbuse of officials may result in disqualification from the\ncompetition.\nReceiving outside assistance, direction, or advice.\nTaking any telecommunication device into the security area.\n\nEvents\nAll events\nAll events\n\nAll events\nAll events\nAll events\n\nAll events\nSERC\nSERC\n\n9.
